( @entity1 ) @entity0 had the idea for " @entity3 " when he was 7 years old . " this was before the @entity8 , and my access to tv and video games was pretty limited , " the producer recalled thursday , in the midst of the " @entity3 " frenzy . " so all you really had was ( to ) tell people stories . so i 'd tell people ' captain planet ' stories , and then i started telling them these dark ' @entity18 ' stories . " and i got into trouble , " he added . " because the parents were like , ' this guy , he 's ruining our children ! ' " that was more than 20 years ago for @entity0 . but the producer , now 30 , got his wish when his dark version of the " @entity28 , " directed by friend @entity29 , made it online -- and proceeded to rack up more than 11 million views on @entity32 in less than two days . fans buzzing over bloody ' @entity3 ' ' bootleg ' in some ways , @entity0 is still getting into trouble . not only did the video explode the @entity28 mythology , showing the impact of serving as " child soldiers , " in @entity0 's phrase , but the video became a legal football after the owner of the franchise , @entity45 , claimed infringement . first it was taken down from @entity48 and then @entity32 . however , it was reposted in both places late friday after lawyers reached agreement , @entity49 reported . among the additions : a disclaimer from @entity0 that his " bootleg " is " my take on the @entity55 . not a pilot , not a series , not for profit , strictly for exhibition . this is a bootleg experiment not affiliated or endorsed by @entity45 or @entity61 nor is it selling any product . i claim no rights to any of the characters ( do n't send me any money , not kickstarted , this film is free ) . " @entity45 has its own plans to reboot the popular ' 90s franchise with a theatrical film scheduled for 2016 . ' an interesting experiment ' so who are these guys , anyway ? @entity29 is a famed music video director , probably best known for @entity75 ' " @entity74 , " @entity77 's " @entity81 " ( for which he won a @entity79 ) and @entity80 's " @entity76 . " he 's also handled a number of commercials and the films " detention " and " @entity86 . " @entity0 is a producer of such films as " @entity88 , " " @entity89 " and " @entity90 . " this is n't the first time he 's made a " bootleg " short . previous videos have included one featuring @entity96 's @entity95 character and one drawing from @entity96 's @entity99 character . in a @entity100 , @entity29 said that " @entity3 " was " self - funded . " a special effects house , @entity104 , " worked six months on this and took a bath financially , " he added . @entity0 declined to give a budget for " @entity3 , " which was shot over a few days last year , but says it was mainly financed through favors and the principals ' money . " it was all favors , " he says , noting that star @entity112 " is one of my best friends . " the film also starred " @entity116 's " @entity115 . both @entity0 and @entity29 like to subvert concepts and cliches . @entity29 said he was drawn to " @entity3 " because " it was an interesting experiment to play with reboot culture and tone control . ... i did n't come into it to please a fan base , per se , but to experiment with pop culture . " and @entity0 ? even his look tries to upset stereotypes . in the video he made to explain " @entity3 , " he 's wearing eye makeup like the 1970s @entity129 , a look he adopted " because i do n't want to be ( an @entity132 ) stereotype , " he told @entity1 . ' kind of a war brewing ' @entity0 comes by his outlook honestly . the @entity132 - born producer had an itinerant childhood thanks to his father 's job , traveling frequently -- various @entity132 cities , @entity141 , @entity142 -- before moving on to the next place . he came to the @entity144 at 16 . he says he thinks of his childhood as " jarring , " with the only constants comic books , movies and television . " just moving around so much , literally every two years , " he said . " i did n't feel like i had a friend until i was 18 . if you 're moving to a different school , let alone a different country every couple years , it 's kind of jarring as a kid . there was no consistency for me in a cultural context " except for @entity144 movies and pop culture . he attended school at @entity162 in @entity163 , where he founded a successful ad agency , and then moved to @entity165 , which he describes as " a dream of mine . " though both men were successful before , " @entity3 " has given them new visibility -- partly thanks to the bottom - up enthusiasm for the project . both filmmakers wax philosophical about the impact . " @entity8 changes things , " @entity29 tweeted after congratulating supporters . " @entity177 , new rules . " @entity0 observes that " @entity3 " is just another marker in a continuing debate between creativity , intellectual property and fan - driven culture . " there 's kind of a war brewing between the old world and the new world , " he said . " the internet has kind of been a nuclear warhead on a lot of businesses and a lot of industries . ... it 's kind of bizarre to be thrown in the middle of it . i 'm literally just a fan making a fan video . " it 's not about dollars and cents , he added : " is that what we 're about ? we 're one massive consumerist mosh pit ? " in the meantime , he 's got plenty of other projects cooking , including a crime thriller set in a world of both puppets and humans that 's like " a really dark , violent ' @entity212 . ' " it all comes down to the same impulse that drove him to tell stories when he was 7 , he says . " i 'm just a creative dude , " he said .

" @placeholder " became an @entity8 craze last week
