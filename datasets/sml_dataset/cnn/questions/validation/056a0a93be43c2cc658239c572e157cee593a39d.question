( @entity2 ) @entity1 wo n't have his contract renewed as host of " @entity5 " after he apparently busted his producer 's lip and verbally abused him , the @entity0 announced wednesday . @entity1 , who hosted one of the most - watched television shows in the world , was suspended on march 10 after what the @entity12 broadcaster previously described as a " fracas " with producer @entity15 on march 4 . wednesday , the @entity0 released the findings of an internal investigation into the incident . @entity19 , who conducted the investigation , said @entity15 had been " subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by @entity1 " at a hotel in @entity23 after a day of filming . " during the physical attack @entity15 was struck , resulting in swelling and bleeding to his lip , " he said . the physical attack was halted after about 30 seconds by the intervention of a witness , @entity19 said , but @entity1 continued to use " derogatory and abusive language " for a sustained period of time . @entity33 said @entity1 made a number of attempts to apologize over subsequent days and had reported the incident to @entity0 management . @entity0 director general @entity38 issued a statement announcing @entity1 was being dropped . " a member of staff -- who is a completely innocent party -- took himself to @entity43 after a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature . for me a line has been crossed , " he said . " i know how popular the program is and i also know that this decision will divide opinion . " " @entity5 , " fronted by @entity1 , @entity57 and @entity58 , has made a name for itself globally with risky stunts and a brand of blokish humor that often toes the line and regularly steps over it . @entity1 is determinedly anti-politically correct on the topics he rails about , both on the show and in his newspaper and magazine columns . in his statement , @entity38 referenced the @entity0 's diversity , saying it was " a broad church . " " we need distinctive and different voices but they can not come at any price . @entity69 to all at the @entity0 have to be standards of decency and respect , " he said . @entity23 police issued a statement wednesday saying they had asked for the @entity0 's report on the incident . " the information will be assessed appropriately and action will be taken by @entity80 where necessary , " they said . on march 10 , the @entity0 announced that " @entity5 's " march 15 episode had been pulled and this week it canceled four live " @entity5 " shows scheduled for next week in @entity83 , @entity84 . however , it said the programs would be rescheduled and that all other live dates would " run as scheduled . " @entity38 said the @entity0 would " look to renew ' @entity5 ' for 2016 " and that he had asked @entity0 controller @entity87 to " look at how we put out the last programs in the current series . " after his suspension by the @entity0 , @entity1 changed his @entity93 profile to " i am probably a presenter on the @entity95 motoring show , @entity5 . " on wednesday , the wording became past tense : " i used to be a presenter on the @entity95 motoring show , @entity5 . " co-host @entity58 tweeted : " gutted at such a sad end to an era . we 're all three of us idiots in our different ways but it 's been an incredible ride together . " fans had earlier expressed outrage at the @entity0 decision to suspend @entity1 . even media baron @entity108 commented on speculation that @entity1 would be sacked , posting a tweet tuesday night in which he described the presenter as a " funny man with great expertise . " an online petition to have @entity1 reinstated has been signed by more than a million people . fewer than 10,000 people signed a counterpetition calling for him to be fired . last week , a fan dressed as the " @entity121 " -- the anonymous racing car test - driver who was once a regular feature of the show -- drove to the @entity0 's @entity126 headquarters in an armored tank to present the " @entity129 " petition . @entity1 later thanked his supporters in a tweet shared more than 22,000 times . according to the @entity0 website , @entity1 is credited with changing the face of modern motoring journalism . it also adds : " terrifyingly , he might just be the most influential man in motoring . " @entity1 has been at the helm of the program since 1998 , and for more than a decade has fronted the relaunched version with @entity58 and may . the trio 's long - distance challenges in a mix of elite and sometimes barely roadworthy vehicles has earned the program cult status . in 2013 , @entity147 named " @entity5 " the world 's most widely watched factual program , with an estimated 350 million global viewers . the show is sold to 214 territories worldwide . local versions have been made in the @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 . while @entity1 's abrasive style has proven popular with viewers , his on - and off - air comments have earned him a reputation as a politically incorrect maverick who often walks a fine line between humor and offense . last year , he apologized profusely after being accused of mumbling the n - word in a clip that was n't aired . " i 'd actually used the word i was trying to obscure . i was mortified by this , horrified . it is a word i loathe , " @entity1 said in video statement posted online . he 's been accused on other occasions of racism , including characterizing @entity177 as " lazy and feckless " and using the word " slope " over footage of an @entity182 man crossing a bridge during a " @entity5 " special in @entity184 . producer @entity185 later apologized , calling it a " light - hearted word play joke , " and saying that the team was not aware that it was offensive to @entity182 . last week , @entity1 launched into an expletive - filled rant at a charity auction in north @entity126 , verbally attacking his @entity0 bosses . a @entity2 reporter who was at the event said @entity1 swore often as he talked about his suspension from the show , saying the @entity0 had " f * * ked themselves " and had ruined a great show . @entity1 later brushed off the incident , saying the rant was meant " in jest " and was designed to increase bids for the prize being auctioned -- one last lap of the " @entity5 " race track . @entity2 's @entity205 and journalist @entity206 contributed to this report .
