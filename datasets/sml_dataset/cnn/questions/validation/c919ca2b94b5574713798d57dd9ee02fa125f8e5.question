( @entity1 ) @entity0 fell to a lacklustre 1 - 0 defeat at the hands of @entity4 saturday , potentially handing the @entity6 advantage to arch rival @entity7 . a stunning header from @entity9 shortly before half time was enough to win the day for an organized and impressive @entity4 . @entity0 piled on the pressure for much of the second half but could n't find a way past a staunch opponent despite finishing the match with four strikers on the park . @entity18 struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while @entity23 almost doubled @entity4 's lead with another headed chance late on . the result means second placed @entity7 can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table @entity29 sunday . of more immediate concern to @entity0 boss @entity33 after the game , however , was his side 's lack of cutting edge . " i think the problem we are having at the moment is quite clear , " @entity33 told reporters . " we are not finding a way through like we did in the games before . we 've only scored one goal , from a penalty , in two games . " that is the problem we have to fix . we lack efficiency up front . " real are now without a win in two league games while the 4 - 0 february hammering at the hands of city rivals @entity52 , the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947 , is still fresh in the memory . with the second @entity57 fixture of the season against @entity7 only a fortnight away , @entity33 is looking for a quick fix to his side 's attacking inhibitions . however , such worries are of little concern to a @entity4 side celebrating its first win over @entity0 in five years . after a slow start to the season the @entity67 are now up to eighth position . " we are very proud of how hard we worked , " goalscorer @entity23 said in comments carried by the @entity71 news agency . " the three points will prove a huge boost . " " the fans have enjoyed it a lot and they deserved that after the poor performances at @entity79 earlier in the season . " @entity81 continued its seemingly inexorable march to a third consecutive @entity84 title with a come from behind 3 - 1 victory away to @entity86 . @entity87 gave the hosts a surprise lead after 25 minutes but @entity90 levelled shortly after . a second half brace from @entity92 ensured the @entity93 would increase their league at the top of the @entity84 to 11 points as second place @entity98 fell to a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity100 . elsewhere saturday , @entity102 's winning streak came to an end with as @entity105 's revitalized side were held to a 0 - 0 draw with @entity107 . @entity108 returned to the top of the @entity111 table , for 24 hours at least , with a convincing 4 - 1 win over @entity113 at the @entity114 . @entity115 opened the scoring as the first half came to a close before @entity119 doubled the @entity121 's advantage from the penalty spot on the hour mark . substitutes @entity124 and @entity125 secured the win after @entity127 had pulled one back deficit for @entity113 . @entity129 will return to the @entity111 summit should it dispose of @entity131 . read :
