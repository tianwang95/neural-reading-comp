( @entity2 ) @entity1 's @entity0 made the perfect start to his world title defense by winning the opening race of the @entity7 season in @entity8 sunday to lead a @entity10 one - two in @entity11 . polesitter @entity0 controlled the race on the @entity14 street circuit to win from teammate @entity15 of @entity16 . four - time world champion @entity17 took the final podium position for his new team @entity19 , holding off @entity20 in the @entity21 . it was the 34th career victory for two - time world champion @entity0 and underlined the continued dominance of @entity10 as he and @entity15 pulled well clear of their nearest challengers . @entity0 , who was forced to retire early in last year 's @entity8 @entity26 , was taking the checkered flag in @entity11 for the first time since 2008 , when he claimed his first world title for @entity30 . it had all gone completely to plan until coming face to face on the victory podium with movie legend @entity33 , who was conducting the post-race interviews . " hey man , @entity36 , " said a surprised @entity0 . " it is an incredibly feeling to continue winning but also great to be up here with you . " then taking his courage in his hands , @entity0 cheekily told ' @entity43 ' " i thought you were taller ! " after getting the thoughts of @entity15 and @entity17 , who said it was a " very big honor " to gain his first points for @entity19 , @entity33 turned his attention back to @entity48 . the pair signed off by saying together : " i 'll be back , " the catchphrase from @entity33 's iconic 1984 film . with @entity0 winning his seventh race from eight starts , his f1 rivals would probably rather he stayed away and @entity15 admitted " he was driving to his max " but could not match the pace of his teammate . only 11 cars finished the race from a depleted grid of 15 cars , with @entity63 unable to start for @entity64 due to a back injury . pastor @entity66 crashed out on the first lap as the safety car was deployed , while his teammate @entity69 retired early in the 58 - lap race to complete a miserable afternoon for @entity71 . @entity1 's @entity72 in an uncompetitive @entity30 was the only driver to finish without a point in 11th place . his regular teammate @entity75 sat out the race after his nasty crash in pre-season testing in @entity79 , while stand - in @entity80 retired after the warm - up lap. @entity82 looked set to underline @entity19 's improvement when running in fifth place , but had to retire the car , with tv replays indicating his left rear tire was not fitted properly after a pit stop . it left the way clear for rookie @entity91 of @entity92 to claim an unexpected fifth place for @entity94 , which went through the 2014 season without claiming a single point , and also took eighth spot with @entity98 . home hopes rested with @entity100 , third in last year 's title race , but he looked off the pace in the @entity104 in sixth place . @entity107 pair @entity106 and @entity108 finished seventh and 10th , with @entity109 impressing on his @entity7 debut for @entity111 in ninth . @entity114 teenager @entity113 made @entity7 history by becoming the youngest driver to compete in an @entity7 race at 17 years and 166 days , but his hopes were dashed when forced to retire in his @entity111 on the 34th lap.
