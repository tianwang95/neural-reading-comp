( @entity2 ) what does it take to help a single dolphin entangled in fishing line ? in the recent case of a dolphin calf rescued off the eastern coast of @entity13 , about two days of effort involving seven boats and 35 people from 12 institutions and organizations . and that was after four weeks spent finding him and evaluating his situation to see whether it warranted intervention . with spring approaching , marine experts say it 's a good reminder to look after your belongings when you take to the water . from plastic bags to swimming trunks to crab pots , marine life can get entangled in all manner of human debris . with limited time and resources , experts ca n't save them all . " you really want to make sure you keep all your hands on your stuff , " said @entity34 , @entity37 ' assistant marine mammal stranding coordinator for the southeast region . " we feel a special responsibility in cases where an animal 's health is in danger because of debris introduced by humans , " said @entity42 , who was involved in last week 's rescue . so where does an intervention begin ? a couple spotted the calf off the coast of @entity57 with monofilament line wrapped around his rostrum , or snout . the mammal was riding the wake of their boat . they reported it january 18 to the @entity67 , which set out to find the calf and his mother . the group found the pair and took more pictures , which were sent to the @entity74 on february 9 for evaluation . the photos revealed monofilament line wrapped around the calf 's upper jaw , cutting into the tissue to the bone , threatening his ability to eat or possibly leading to infection . veterinarians who reviewed the photos deemed the injuries potentially life - threatening . " we ca n't disentangle every animal , " @entity42 said , " but if it comes back as life - threatening , we mobilize to do disentanglement . " the next step was to find the creatures again . through characteristics on the mother 's dorsal fin , the group was able to identify her through records on file and target her home range for a search . after a two - day search , the group found the dolphins on friday and approached for intervention . the process took about an hour , from netting the calf and his mother to sending them on their way , @entity42 said . apart from the fishing line both mother and son were in good condition . rescuers gave the calf a long - lasting antibiotic and radio - tagged the mother before releasing them to the ocean " where they belong , " @entity42 said . the moral of the story for humans : " be conscious of your gear . " to report an injured marine mammal , call 877 - @entity126 ( 877 - 942 - 5343 ) .
