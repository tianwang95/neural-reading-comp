( @entity1 ) about 15 years ago , i was doing research on inheritance laws in @entity4 and their impact on women . part of my research methodology was to engage in focus group discussions with women in village settings . in order to do this in any village in @entity4 , one has to seek permission from the village chief . and so i did . the chief told me to come back the next day so that he can have time to mobilize the women , as well as give them proper notice of the proposed discussion . when i came back the next day , the " women " had indeed gathered waiting for me . however i noticed that the " women " were not women , as such . they were ... kids . teenage girls . i said to the chief " i was hoping to talk to women and not to kids or girls , as i do n't think they would understand much about inheritance . " his response was , " but these are our women ; look , they have babies with them and they are all married . " i was shocked . then it dawned on me , " aah , girl - child marriages . " after asking , i found the girls ' ages ranged from 13 to 18 , with two being 24 . this then spurred me into action and it was the beginning of a decade - plus journey of understanding girl - child marriages in my country and fighting for the practice to end . what i found out was disheartening as the statistics came in . i was horrified to learn that @entity4 has one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world . it is ranked eighth of the 20 countries that are considered to have the highest rates of child marriage by the @entity58 . on average , one out of two girls in @entity4 will be married by their 18th birthday , according to the @entity62 . in 2010 , half of the women ( 50 % ) aged 20 -- 24 years were married or in a union before age 18 ( compared to 6.4 % of boys ) , while 12 % of women married before they were 15 compared to only 1.2 % of men . child marriage is in both rural and urban areas . it is also higher than the regional average for @entity74 ( 37 % ) . ' law , save the girls ! ' being a lawyer , i looked to the law . " my hero the law , save the girls , " i thought ! yet , i soon found out that this was a complex story . the @entity84 of @entity4 , which is the supreme law of the land from whom all legal authority is derived , has provided for some measures of protection for all children . however the same @entity84 defines children as those aged 16 and below . the @entity62 defines children as those aged 18 and below and so to that extent the @entity84 does not comply with international standards on definitions of childhood . the @entity84 also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut - off point where marriage is actually prohibited . this means for all intents and purposes , the @entity103 of @entity4 allows child marriages . alas the law had failed me ! false hope ? but there was hope in the air . in february , @entity4 's parliament passed the @entity113 of 2015 into law . this law was born amid the outcry against girl - child marriage , as the country had realized the dangers of girl - child marriage . save for a few areas , it is a very progressive piece of legislation , particularly from a women 's rights perspective . among other things , the law prohibits marriage for anybody below the age of 18 . so , does it mean that the constitutional provisions fall away ? the spanner in the works is that since the @entity84 allows marriage below the age of 18 , the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid . so whilst many have celebrated the new law , i have n't , as girls remain shackled by a @entity145 provision that basically allows child marriage . so until the @entity84 changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above , and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated , i will remain sad as i was 15 years ago . ' guarantee for poverty ' i will remain sad because i know the cost of child marriage . it deprives girls of education and undermines their self - confidence and self - identity . it also makes them prone to physical and emotional abuse by their so called husbands . further to this , girl - child marriage inevitably means early parentage and higher risks of maternal mortality . as if this is not enough , studies have shown that girl - child marriage is a risk factor in the transmission of @entity178 and other sexually transmitted infections , as young wives do not have much bargaining power to negotiate safe sex with older men . girl - child marriages need to be prohibited tough the @entity84 because they are a violation of every conceivable human right including the right to life , health , education , human dignity and development . what i know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and i want it to end . no ifs or buts . more from @entity204 voices more from opinions the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .

50 % of girls in @placeholder will be married by the time they turn 18
