( @entity0 ) the desert and dun - colored cliffs around the town of @entity4 were once the backdrop for the movie " @entity10 , " much of which was filmed in this neglected corner of @entity9 in 1976 . this struggling town on the fringes of the @entity13 still draws a few fans of the movie but now finds itself part of a real conflict , as a way - station for jihadists crossing the @entity20 border 60 miles to the east . earlier this month , before the gun attack on the @entity24 in @entity25 , three young men were arrested here as they allegedly made plans to cross into @entity20 to join a terrorist network . a local official told @entity0 they had since been taken to @entity25 for questioning . two arms caches have also been found in the region this month , one of which included rocket - propelled grenade launchers and more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition , thought to have been removed from a @entity20 armory in the aftermath of @entity39 's ouster in 2011 . driving near the border , it 's quickly obvious why the @entity9 government is so anxious about @entity20 's implosion and the emergence there of an @entity46 affiliate whose tentacles stretch half - way across the country . this open space is vast and sparsely populated . smugglers ' tracks criss - cross the endless scrub and steep , arid hills that run along the border . gasoline , drugs and other contraband have long been smuggled across the frontier . near the town of @entity63 , south of @entity4 , a couple of soldiers manned a checkpoint . they wore protective jackets -- whether for show or because of the perceived threat from @entity71 militants , it 's hard to know . when we arrived , passports were requested and phone calls made . we were escorted into the town and politely but firmly told we could go no further without written authorization . exactly four years ago we had passed through @entity63 unchallenged . tunisians had just launched the @entity77 . there was a mood of heady optimism and the security apparatus of the @entity83 regime had melted away . but already @entity20 was falling apart , as different groups of rebels fought to oust @entity39 . thousands of foreign workers were then trying to escape the violence through the few official border crossings . now @entity20 's descent into chaos means those crossings are sometimes closed , and it 's foreign fighters using the smugglers ' trails that @entity9 must worry about . at the national guard building in @entity63 the officer in charge -- a burly figure in his mid- 40s - was wearing a " @entity101 1999 " sweatshirt and appeared to be one of many plainclothes security personnel in the town . he was happy to talk but did n't want his name reported . ignoring calls on his cell phone , he lamented the state of the @entity111 world and the expansion of @entity113 , as @entity46 is frequently called . look at @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity20 ... . of course @entity9 is threatened , he said . the @entity9 are doing what they can , he said . there is now a 1.8 - mile no - go zone inside the border , and the military has built fortified positions every couple of miles . the security presence has been boosted seven - to ten-fold , but even so there were n't enough men or equipment . the border , after all , is 380 miles long . a much wider buffer zone -- 12 miles deep -- has also been created , which people can only enter with permission . this has not gone down well with local herders whose goats and sheep live off the desert scrub . other measures taken by the @entity9 authorities , according to the official in @entity63 , include a ban on men aged 18 - 35 from going to @entity20 unless they have residence papers and proof of employment there . another source said the ban applied to men under 30 . even so the two gunmen who stormed into the @entity24 last week -- both of them in their twenties -- had been able to cross illicitly into @entity20 in december , according to @entity9 state security minister @entity151 . @entity152 told a @entity9 network that the pair had received weapons training in the @entity46 stronghold of @entity157 . the mood among many @entity9 seems much harder and more pragmatic than it was four years ago . a shopkeeper in a small village between @entity4 and @entity63 said there needs to be a security crackdown . he said people in the area led simple lives -- but they knew each other and noticed strangers . @entity169 , a taxi driver on the island of @entity171 , some 60 miles to the north of @entity4 , was of a similar view . " the people need to be the third eye of the security forces " he said . " and we need to think of the safety of visitors like we think of the safety of our families . " @entity169 and hundreds of thousands of other @entity9 have reason to be worried . they rely on tourism to make a living , and fear that @entity46 will -- as it has threatened -- launch further attacks against foreigners visiting @entity20 . @entity169 ferries tourists around @entity171 , whose luxury hotels and beaches are a popular destination for @entity192 and @entity193 tourists . it took the tourist industry years to recover from a terror attack on a synagogue on the island in 2002 in which 21 people were killed . @entity169 says he 's heard all too many horror stories about events in @entity20 from the oil workers he took to @entity171 's airport . others , mainly in the capital @entity25 , are apprehensive that the democratic gains of four years ago may be eroded or lost in a new security clampdown . they point to new anti-terrorism legislation that strengthens detention powers and the right of the authorities to monitor suspects ' phones and social media . the measure was being discussed in parliament wednesday when the attack was launched on the adjacent museum . tunisians say their country is at a crossroads as it tries to fend off the jihadist contagion seeping across @entity223 . their democracy is young and vulnerable . " we want to be the hope of the @entity111 world , " said @entity169 , " like we were four years ago . " " we still have hope , but now we have fear too . "

@placeholder officials worry about the area because of its proximity to @entity20 , and @entity46
