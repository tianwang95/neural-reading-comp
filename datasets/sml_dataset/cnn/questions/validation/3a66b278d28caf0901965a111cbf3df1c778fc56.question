( @entity1 ) @entity0 could not keep the @entity2 in the @entity3 on sunday , so it was likely small consolation that his incredible tennis milestone remained unbeaten . while the @entity2 lost to @entity7 in @entity8 , putting @entity9 into the quarterfinals of the prestigious teams event , halfway across the world an absorbing battle was playing out between two of @entity16 's most bitter rivals . in the end it did n't come close to matching @entity0 's 11 - hour marathon against @entity20 at @entity21 in 2010 , but the fourth rubber in the clash between @entity24 and @entity25 made its own piece of history . for six hour and 43 minutes , @entity28 and @entity29 contested the second - longest singles match in tennis history -- and third longest of any format after a seven - hour doubles clash between @entity34 and the @entity35 in 2013 . @entity28 eventually triumphed , after his 11th match point , winning 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 5 - 7 5 - 7 15 - 13 in front of a delirious home crowd in @entity39 to send the tie to a deciding rubber . it set the scene for @entity44 to take on @entity25 's @entity45 in the decider -- with the winner to earn a clash with @entity50 's @entity49 , a 5 - 0 victor over @entity54 rival @entity52 . @entity44 had won the first set 6 - 3 when play was halted for the day due to bad light . the match will resume on monday . meanwhile , back in @entity61 , the @entity60 team celebrated after earning a home quarterfinal clash with @entity63 on july 17 - 19 , the weekend after the completion of @entity21 . " it was an incredible experience , " said world @entity65 , who beat @entity0 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) in two and a half hours to give his team a 3 - 1 lead and ensure a repeat of the result of last year 's first - round clash between the two nations . " playing in front of a home crowd is a bit more pressured , especially today , but i managed to fight my way through the first set and played really well after that . " it was the second defeat of the tie for the big - serving @entity0 , who lost a five - hour five - setter against @entity83 on friday . the @entity87 , without leading players @entity84 and @entity86 , crashed out at the first hurdle with a 3 - 2 defeat in @entity90 . @entity91 makes their way into the quarterfinals for the second time in three years after beating @entity95 3 - 2 . @entity96 led the tie - break victory by defeating @entity98 in straight sets on sunday . @entity91 will face @entity90 in july , after @entity21 concludes . @entity63 , beaten by @entity34 in last year 's final , went through after beating @entity100 3 - 2 -- losing both of sunday 's meaningless singles rubbers having already secured victory in the doubles 24 hours earlier . @entity104 conquered three - time champion @entity35 , a semifinalist last year , with @entity108 clinching victory in the fourth rubber against @entity110 . seeking a 29th title , but first since 2003 , the @entity104 will next host @entity112 -- which defeated @entity113 3 - 2 as @entity114 overcame @entity115 in a five - set decider after trailing 2 - 1 .
