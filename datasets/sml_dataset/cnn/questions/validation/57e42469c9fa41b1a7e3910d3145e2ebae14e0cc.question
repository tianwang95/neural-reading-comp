@entity0 ( @entity1 ) it was 9:35 on a slow thursday night in april 2013 and @entity3 police chief @entity2 was about to call it quits . on his way out , he saw one of his rookie swing - shift officers , @entity9 , sitting in his cruiser . he stopped to say goodnight . " i chatted with him for a few minutes . i told him to be safe and i left , " the chief told a crowded courtroom on wednesday . he estimated the conversation lasted three , maybe four minutes . " did you ever see @entity9 alive again after that ? " assistant u.s. attorney @entity19 asked . " i did not . " less than an hour later , @entity9 lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head . his car door was open , and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals . @entity2 and other officers , assisted by surveillance videos , 911 callers and a lone bicyclist who happened to be passing by , recounted @entity9 's last moments in the death penalty trial of admitted @entity33 bomber @entity32 . the bicyclist , @entity3 mathematics ph.d. candidate @entity34 , pointed to @entity32 in court and identified him as the man with " a big nose , " who he saw leaning into @entity9 's squad car . he said @entity32 appeared to be alone . @entity32 , who was 19 at the time , does not dispute that he was present when @entity9 was killed on the evening of april 18 , nor does he deny that he participated in the bombings three days earlier that killed three people and hurt more than 240 others . prosecutors say @entity32 and his older brother , @entity44 , killed @entity9 because they wanted his gun . but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster . the @entity49 had released photos of the pair five hours earlier , and they were on the run . but @entity44 , 26 , would not survive the night . he was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an " officer down " at @entity3 . the @entity3 police , who are designated as special officers by the @entity61 , patrol the sprawling campus in @entity63 . @entity9 's beat was the area of @entity66 near @entity68 and @entity69 streets . he had been handling a routine call about a citizen who was upset his car had been towed . a young man called 911 about 10:20 p.m. and reported hearing loud noises outside his window . " they do n't sound exactly like gunshots , " the caller told dispatcher @entity77 . he was n't sure what they were . maybe somebody banging on trash cans . @entity77 tried to summon @entity9 on his police radio . no response . he sent an emergency alert . nothing . he tried texting him . still no response . " it became an amount of time that was n't comfortable , " he said . sgt. @entity93 had returned to the station at the end of his shift , and had just passed @entity9 on the way in . he saw nothing out of the ordinary . but when he heard dispatch could n't raise @entity9 , he went back out to check on him . his car was in the same spot . " i parked about 8 - 10 meters away from officer @entity9 's car , " @entity93 said . " when i arrived at the cruiser i looked inside and that 's when i observed a wound to the head , to the temple . i observed a wound to the neck and i observed a wound to his hand . " prosecutor @entity19 asked : " was there blood ? " " yes sir , " the witness responded . " where ? " " all over the car and his body . " jurors heard @entity93 's frantic call over the police radio : " officer down ! officer down ! get me help ! officer down . " he called for an ambulance , shouting , " get on it ! ! ! " he and another officer pulled @entity131 out of the squad car to attempt to revive him . " the amount of blood on his body made it difficult to get a grip on him , " @entity93 said . the other officer urged @entity9 to " @entity139 in there , just hang in there , " and asked " who did this to you ? " @entity9 did not respond . @entity63 police officer @entity145 joined them , and took over applying chest compressions . " his face and neck were covered with blood . there was some type of wound to his head , " @entity145 said . @entity9 was gurgling and blood was coming from his mouth " there was blood everywhere , " @entity145 added . @entity19 asked , " did it transfer to you ? " " all over me . " @entity9 became the fourth victim of the @entity32 brothers . campus surveillance cameras captured the encounter between @entity9 and his killer . the footage was shot from a distance and at times , it is difficult to determine whether the cameras captured one person and a shadow or a pair walking closely together . the video shows @entity9 's patrol car idling near the front of the @entity178 building , and a person or two people rounding the corner and walking towards it . the brake lights flash on , then off , and then off again . two people can be seen running back around the corner . off to the side , somebody on a bicycle rides by without stopping . @entity34 , the grad student on the bicycle , often used the word " they " in his testimony at first , but said he saw just one person as he pedaled past . " when i went by , the front door was open , the driver 's side door , " he said . " there was someone leaning into the driver 's side door . " he said the person -- although he used the word " they " -- was bent at the waist and leaning into the patrol car . " they stood up , startled , as i rode my bike by them , " he added . later in his testimony , he began referring to " they " as " he . " " i only saw one person , " he said . " he sort of snapped up , stood up , and turned around . he looked startled . we made eye contact . " asked to describe who he saw , @entity34 added , " i remember thinking he had a big nose . " he looked across the courtroom at @entity32 , pointed , and said , " he 's right there . " the prosecution 's case has brought one dramatic day of testimony after another in the federal courthouse overlooking @entity222 . on tuesday , prosecutors displayed photos of what they called @entity32 's " manifesto , " scrawled in pencil on the sides of a dry - docked pleasure boat where he sought refuge april 19 . blood streaks and bullet holes punctuated his words , which he does not deny writing . the only issue in dispute is whether it is a confession or something else .

testimony focuses on shooting death of @placeholder officer , 26
