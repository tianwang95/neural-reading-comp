( @entity2 ) " hey dude -- can you turn your music down ? " if anyone says this to you while you 're wearing your earbuds , take note : you are probably endangering your hearing . more than one billion teens and young adults are at risk of losing their hearing , according to @entity13 ( that 's the @entity13 , not the rock band ) . it 's not just old folks who suffer hearing loss . just by listening to music at what you probably think is a normal level , or hanging out in loud bars , nightclubs and music and sporting events , you can permanently damage your hearing . by analyzing listening habits of 12 - to 35 - year - olds in wealthier countries around the world , who found nearly 50 % of those studied listen to unsafe sound levels on personal audio devices and about 40 % are exposed to damaging levels of music and noise at entertainment venues . it does n't take much time to damage your hearing at a sports bar or nightclub . according to the @entity13 , " exposure to noise levels of @entity43 , which is typical in such venues , is safe for no more than 15 minutes . " once you lose your hearing , it wo n't come back . rapper @entity47 and @entity48 lead singer @entity46 know that all too well . they both suffer from tinnitus , hearing loss that causes a permanent and irritating ringing in the ears , because they did n't protect their hearing . now they 've joined forces with a @entity60 hearing loss association to warn others . " i suffer from tinnitus , " says @entity47 on @entity62 . " when i first developed it , i thought it was trains rushing by my house as i live near a railway line . it was really loud and an extremely high pitched ringing in my ears . i now have to wear special earplugs when i go to bed to help stop my ears from ringing . " " looking after your ears is unfortunately something you do n't think about until there 's a problem , " says @entity46 . " i 've had tinnitus for about 10 years , and since i started protecting my ears , it has n't got any worse ( touch wood ) . but i wish i 'd thought about it earlier . " when it comes to personal listening devices , the level of damage you can cause to your ears is directly correlated to how long you listen and how loud the sound . " unsafe levels of sounds can be , for example , exposure to in excess of @entity94 for eight hours or @entity95 for 15 minutes , " says @entity13 . eighty - five decibels is n't all that loud . according to the @entity98 , it 's about the level of city traffic that you 'd heard from inside your car . some 360 million of us have already suffered moderate to severe hearing loss , according to the @entity105 . while that number does include factors out of our control , such as aging , genetics , birth defects , infections and disease , about half of all cases were avoidable . that 's why @entity13 has launched the make listening safe initiative . part of the campaign is to encourage manufacturers to create audio safety features on devices and then educate consumers on how to use them . who is also calling on governments to create and enforce recreational noise legislation . " parents , teachers and physicians can educate young people about safe listening , while managers of entertainment venues can respect the safe noise levels set by their respective venues , use sound limiters and offer earplugs and ' chill out ' rooms to patrons , " says @entity13 . in the end , it 's up to each of us to protect our own hearing . the good news is that it 's easy to do . when it comes to your personal audio devices , such as your smartphone : -- turn the volume down . do n't go above 60 % . -- wear noise canceling earbuds , or better yet , headphones . -- take " listening breaks " or only listen for just an hour a day -- get an app for that . download a smartphone app to help monitor safe listening levels . and the next time you go to a bar , nightclub , sports event or concert , use ear protection . @entity46 does . " now we always use moulded filter plugs , or in - ear monitors , to try and protect our ears , " says @entity46 . and his kids never go to a concert without big , noise - canceling headphones .
