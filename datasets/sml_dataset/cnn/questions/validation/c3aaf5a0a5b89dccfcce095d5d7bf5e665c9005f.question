@entity7 ( @entity8 ) in his first substantive comments since @entity4 critic @entity3 's death , @entity6 president @entity5 on wednesday called the killing a " disgrace " and lashed out at what he called " extremists " and protesters . @entity3 had been one of @entity5 's harshest critics and had been arrested several times for speaking against the president 's government . the 55 - year - old opposition leader was gunned down friday night in @entity7 as he walked across a bridge about 100 meters ( 330 feet ) from the @entity4 with his girlfriend , @entity22 model @entity20 , 23 . his slaying spurred thousands to rally in his honor in @entity7 , with many calling him a true @entity6 patriot at his funeral tuesday . @entity3 is n't the first of @entity5 's critics to turn up dead , with others including @entity32 ( who was fatally shot ) and @entity33 ( who was poisoned ) . the @entity4 has staunchly denied accusations that it 's targeting political opponents or had anything to do with the deaths . the @entity6 leader has condemned @entity3 's killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate , the @entity4 has said . he also wrote to @entity3 's mother , saying he shared her grief , and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice . yet those expressions came in @entity4 statements . wednesday was the first day @entity5 spoke at length on the subject , remarks that were reported by state media outlets . referring to " the daring killing of @entity3 in the very heart of our capital city , " he said , " @entity6 should be made secure , at last , from the disgrace and tragedies of ( this ) kind . " the president added , according to the official @entity62 news agency , " the most serious attention should be paid to high - profile crimes , including those having political motives . " no one has been arrested in connection with @entity3 's death , though @entity6 's @entity71 chief @entity70 did say there are suspects , @entity62 reported . the same agency , citing @entity6 's @entity74 , said that investigators are looking for a car that belongs to a state enterprise that provides services to that ministry . @entity5 did n't identify any person or group that might be directly responsible . but wednesday he took the opportunity to lay blame generally at what he called " color technologies , " an apparent reference to using mass street protests and overseas funding to try to overthrow a government . " the actions of extremists are becoming more and more widespread , " the president said . " we are running into attempts of using so - called color technologies , from organizing illegal street protests to open propaganda ( expressing ) hatred in social networks . " @entity8 's @entity102 reported from @entity7 , and @entity8 's @entity103 wrote from @entity104 . @entity8 's @entity105 and @entity106 contributed to this report .
