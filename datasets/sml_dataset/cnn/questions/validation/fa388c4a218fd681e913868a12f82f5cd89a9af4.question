( @entity1 ) @entity0 was sold into the sex trade by a family member when she was only 12 years old . her life became a prison : chained to a bed in a warehouse , she endured regular beatings , rapes and once was even set on fire by her captors as she was forced to serve 5 to 30 men every day . the experience was enough for her to wish she was dead . and this all took place in @entity16 -- right here , in our own country . @entity0 miraculously escaped her captors but , as is the case with so many other victims , she struggled for years to distance herself from her past , even finding herself in jail on multiple occasions . and while institutionalized slavery has long been cast from @entity28 's history books , thousands of children still suffer from the bonds of sex trafficking . indeed , with the average age of a victim only 13 years old , these horrific crimes are stealing the innocent childhoods of kids across @entity28 . and the problem is n't confined to one part of the country . in , @entity41 , for example , a 12 - year - old girl received a text message that she thought was from a friend . it invited her to go to a party and asked her to go to a fast food restaurant nearby . but she did n't get to a party . instead , she was taken to a hotel and raped by a 34 - year - old pimp , forced to take explicit photos of herself that were then posted on @entity52 , before being forced to have sex with two more men who saw the post . these heartbreaking stories demonstrate what is broken about our current system , and why we both feel committed to fixing it . instead of treating people like these young girls as the victims they are , they are often thrown into the criminal justice system , labeled prostitutes and left with few options but to return to a nightmare that shockingly still exists in the @entity28 . meanwhile , instead of treating their perpetrators as child rapists and traffickers , they are often simply treated as " @entity73 " who , if caught , often pay a fine and go on their way . this is outrageous , and should not be tolerated any longer . that is why we 've joined forces with more than 200 advocacy groups to fight this modern - day slave trade and provide hope and opportunity for its victims . two bills we have introduced to combat this horrific crime recently passed the @entity88 with strong support and will have the opportunity for consideration by the @entity88 . the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) would support victims by taking fines and criminal assets from convicted human traffickers and directing them toward services and treatment to help victims restore their lives . the @entity92 does n't only help victims , it also arms law enforcement with more tools to go after human traffickers . it ensures these criminals , including " @entity73 , " are brought to justice under our laws , because a financial transaction should not mask assault on a child . the second bill is modeled after @entity41 's " @entity117 " law , which helps make sure minors sold for sex are n't prosecuted as defendants , but are instead treated as victims . the @entity119 ( @entity120 ) would give incentives for all states to have a safe harbor provision . when a state passes a safe harbor law , it means that kids sold for sex are steered towards child protection services , rather than being arrested , charged , or convicted under a state 's criminal statutes . all across the country , from @entity16 to @entity41 , young people are being robbed of their innocence and subjected to unthinkable horrors and abuse . we must do everything we can to free them from the shackles of sex trafficking . we must join together and take action to combat this modern - day slavery once and for all .
