( @entity1 ) there 's a steady stream of blood flowing down his face from a cut just above his eye . his rapid , open - mouth breathing inadvertently draws some of the blood inside , discoloring his teeth . he appears dazed , probably with a concussion . but there are no trained physicians around to evaluate . and even if there were , it 's doubtful anything a doctor could say would stop him from fighting . the crowd that has gathered in this backyard of a @entity23 suburb wo n't let him . they have too much money invested . besides , this illegal fight is the safest way he can make money . and his best chance of reaching the @entity32 . when i first saw this footage from the documentary " @entity36 , " i recoiled . here we are recognizing the 50th anniversary of " @entity39 " in @entity40 , @entity41 , and in the next state over there are desperate , unemployed black men beating the hell out of each other for a hundred bucks . while the 1999 cult classic " @entity56 " made organized street fights look like a sexy form of psychotherapy for repressed men ( and some of the guys who participate in street fights do fit the bill ) , the vast majority in the documentary just need the money . because in the @entity23 area the poor reportedly live on $ 11 a day . and in @entity61 , the suburb where " @entity36 " takes place and where nearly 75 % of the residents are black , unemployment remains high . " this is the future of @entity67 , " said the film 's director , @entity64 . " when you look at the incarceration rate , especially for black men , and income inequality , the life you see in ' @entity36 ' is where we are headed . " we have these ridiculous drug laws , which makes it nearly impossible to get a job once you 've been arrested . and if you can get a job , it does n't pay enough to feed a family . " the numbers speak for themselves . the @entity67 has 5 % of the world 's population but 25 % of its prisoners -- by far the most of any country . meanwhile , between 2009 and 2012 , the top 1 % of @entity67 captured 95 % of all income growth . so while it is true unemployment is down and @entity96 is booming , the combination of a debilitating criminal justice system and low wages has created an environment in which men such as those featured in " @entity36 " feel backyard fights are actually one of the less nefarious ways they can make money . sens. @entity104 , @entity106 , and @entity107 , @entity108 , have become interesting bedfellows as they work to address the country 's runaway prison industry . this week , the pair , along with sen. @entity113 , @entity115 - @entity114 , introduced a medical marijuana bill as another step toward decriminalizing the drug . this is a welcome step , because of the 8.2 million marijuana arrests between 2001 - 2010 , nearly 90 % was for simple possession , according to the @entity122 . and while whites and blacks use the drug at the same rate , blacks were arrested four times as often , the @entity122 said . that 's not to say all of the ex-cons in the 12 - by - 12 ring are nonviolent drug offenders . some , by their own admission , have done worse . but they are out of jail now , and do n't have the luxury of waiting to see if debates going on in @entity139 actually result in laws . " i do n't promote violence , i promote hope , " said @entity141 5000 , who started @entity61 fights in his mother 's backyard and who was once a bodyguard for mixed martial arts fighter @entity145 . " a lot of these men paid their debt back to society ; they did the rehab , but they still ca n't get a job . they do n't blame society for their life . ... ( @entity158 ) hey are back here in these streets , and they would like a second chance , a chance to do the right thing , but those chances are not there . we are an alternative to the bad things . " i asked if the election of the first black president provided any inspiration at all , and he said , " @entity174 's black , but he did n't grow up black , not like this . " he never had to make do , to go without . he never was put inside those situations , those circumstances where desperation pushes you to the edge . he 's had what he thinks are hard times , but it 's nothing like this . if he came down here , he would be blown away . " @entity64 echoes the sentiment . " the unemployment rate is all well and good for people in @entity139 , but those are not the people who are trying to make it , " he said . " people think of @entity23 , they think of beaches and @entity193 and all of that . this is the part of @entity23 people do n't want to talk about . " but you know what ? @entity23 is not unique . there are a lot of cities like this , " he adds . " @entity36 " certainly does n't sugarcoat anything . the fights are raw , vicious . but then so is the reality in which it is based . two of the fighters featured are dead -- including one on whom police used a @entity212 . with prize money as little as $ 100 , the chances this lifestyle alone can elevate a family out of poverty is slim to none . but what are the alternatives ? i grew up in a rough neighborhood on the eastside of @entity224 . i was mugged in elementary school by a grown man . and even i do n't claim to know the desperation these men see on a daily basis . " we do n't have @entity231 and @entity232 coming down here to this level of hood , " @entity141 said . " this is the real @entity23 . we may not want to acknowledge it , but it is . " and i bet if you go to some of the other cities where men do n't have any skills , they do n't have an education , they may have a record ... you 'll find the same thing , " he added . " what i 'm doing is n't barbaric , it 's a message . "
