( @entity4 ) two extremists who attacked a landmark museum in @entity2 , killing 23 people , got weapons training at camps in @entity7 , an official said friday . the suspects were activated from sleeper cells in @entity2 , security minister @entity9 said . he did not say which group activated them , or with whom they trained . " they left the country illegally last december for @entity7 , and they were able to train with weapons there , " he told private broadcaster @entity14 . like @entity2 , @entity7 saw its longtime leader @entity21 ousted during the regional wave of revolutions known as the @entity24 . but unlike its neighbor to the west , @entity7 has been fraught with more instability and violence -- much of it perpetrated by @entity31 militants , like those behind the 2012 @entity34 attack that killed @entity36 ambassador @entity35 and three other @entity36 . such violence has been rare in @entity2 , at least on the scale of what happened wednesday at the @entity40 in @entity41 . still , it is not a total shock , given that up to 3,000 @entity2 have left to fight as jihadists in @entity45 and @entity46 , according to the @entity47 for the @entity48 in @entity49 , not to mention others who have joined radical groups closer to home . already , authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the attack , including four directly linked to it , according to a statement from @entity2 president @entity59 . and in an audio message posted online thursday , @entity60 claimed responsibility for the attack , which it said targeted " crusaders and apostates " with " automatic weapons and hand grenades . " @entity4 can not independently verify the legitimacy of the audio statement . that bloodshed is " just the start , " the @entity60 message warned -- a threat that may or may not be hollow , but nonetheless adds extra urgency for @entity2 investigators . the nation 's security forces are working to break up other cells like those behind the recent @entity40 attack . but that 's not necessarily going to be fast or easy . " we know they can launch operations , but we must piece together clues in order to conduct an arrest , " @entity82 said . as investigators continued their work , @entity2 turned out friday to mark the @entity93 nation 's independence from @entity94 . those commemorations were more somber this year , but they were also in many ways more significant . " i 'm here to celebrate 59 years of our independence , " said @entity97 , 38 , a school inspector in @entity41 . " the most important thing now is to properly investigate and to find those responsible . " @entity2 has been shaken by the terrorist attack , though it was foreigners -- 19 of them tourists who 'd been on two cruise ships that docked in @entity41 -- who made up the vast majority of victims . fifteen victims ' bodies are at a morgue in the capital , a forensic official said . some of them have n't been identified two days after the attack , according to the official , and all are foreigners . the fear is that many other tourists wo n't come back . already , the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims , @entity121 and @entity122 , have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in @entity41 for 2015 and substituted them with other ports . that means some foreigners wo n't be coming to @entity2 as once expected . but it does n't mean all tourists will stay away -- as illustrated by a movement online of people vowing , " i will come to @entity2 . " beyond tourism , @entity2 also hope to get support from other countries as they fight terrorism . " i hope other countries will support @entity2 , like they supported @entity94 after @entity148 , " said @entity141 , 33 , who works for an export company , referring to the january massacre at the satirical magazine 's offices in @entity146 . " we are @entity2 , this is our country . not theirs , they ( the terrorists ) are bastards of children . we have centuries of history . " @entity4 's @entity156 , @entity157 and journalist @entity158 contributed to this report .
