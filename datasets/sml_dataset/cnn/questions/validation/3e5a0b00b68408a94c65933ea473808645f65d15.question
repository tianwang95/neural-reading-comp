( @entity1 ) a previously unknown species of catfish has been named for the wide - eyed , puckered - mouth " @entity5 " character it resembles . its scientific name is @entity8 , and it is known for its large , dark eyes , puckered lips and protruding bristles . but you can call him @entity14 , in honor of the bounty hunter from " @entity17 : a @entity17 . " you might remember him from the cantina scene on @entity20 , where he was killed by @entity22 while attempting to collect on a debt for @entity24 . " i think it was the whole package that evoked @entity14 , but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth , " said @entity25 , biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the @entity28 . @entity25 made the connection in september with colleagues @entity33 , @entity35 and @entity36 . but , like many things in academia , it took a while to make it official . the specimens were found in 1998 by researchers along the @entity44 in @entity45 . @entity25 obtained them in 2005 from a museum in @entity48 for a manuscript he was preparing on the genus , " thinking they were unusual . " he designated them as another existing species , @entity54 , in a 2008 paper , " although i had not been comfortable with that designation . " he examined them again in september and discovered they were different from @entity54 . after talking it over with his colleagues , they realized he was a clear ringer for @entity14 . " as a 7 - year - old kid , i watched " @entity5 " in the theater , and it was a life - changing experience for me , " said @entity25 . " i became a lifelong fan , and i now share that with my son . @entity14 has always been a personal favorite of mine . " @entity14 became the object of controversy when @entity72 re-released the original @entity5 in 1997 . a reworked scene showed @entity14 firing a shot at @entity75 fired back . in the 1977 release , @entity22 is the only one to fire , prompting backlash from fans and giving rise to the phrase " @entity81 . "
