( @entity2 ) @entity1 co-founder @entity0 says he has found the wreck of a long - lost @entity6 @entity5 battleship near the @entity7 . the philanthropist posted images on @entity10 that appeared to show the @entity11 , once one of the two largest warships in the world . the discovery was made aboard his superyacht , the @entity16 , as part of an expedition that @entity0 launched . the search has taken @entity0 and his team of researchers more than eight years . the images and video were taken by an unmanned submersible deployed from the vessel . " since my youth , i have been fascinated with @entity6 history , inspired by my father 's service in the @entity31 , " @entity0 said in a statement . " the @entity11 is truly an engineering marvel and , as an engineer at heart , i have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction . i am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her . " he used his @entity10 account to publicize the find . in one tweet , he said one image showed the bow of the ship , which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of @entity56 's royal family -- and a huge anchor . the other underwater photograph shows one of the @entity11 's valves on which the @entity5 characters for " main valve handle " and " open " are legible . he said the writing on the valve was proof that the ship was of @entity5 origin . the director of @entity56 's @entity68 told @entity2 after viewing the information posted by @entity0 that it appeared that the vessel was the @entity11 , although further pictures were needed to know for sure . the @entity11 was one of two @entity73 - class battleships constructed by the @entity74 . launched in 1940 , it was , at the time , the largest class of warship ever constructed , displacing more than 69,000 tons . the @entity11 sank on october 24 , 1944 , during the @entity78 , part of the @entity80 , in the central @entity7 . according to @entity85 documents , torpedo planes from @entity83 aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours . @entity74 dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times , but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the @entity11 . " she went down by the bow , capsizing when the forward flying ( @entity83 forecastle ) deck was submerged , " said the @entity74 report , based on survivor accounts . two of those survivors , the executive officer and the chief engineer , told how they escaped the sinking . " the executive officer swam off from one of the upper levels in the tower . he saw the propellers as @entity11 disappeared , " the @entity74 report said . " the chief engineer climbed over the side amidships as @entity11 lurched to port . he walked and scrambled around the girth against the roll , climbing over the bilge keel . finally , he was thrown off into the water and swam away to port . there were no explosions . " more than 1,000 of the @entity11 's crew were killed during the battle and sinking . the 1,300 - plus survivors were taken aboard by other @entity5 warships , according to the @entity85 report . @entity0 said that his superyacht , the @entity16 , had found the wreck at a depth of around 1 kilometer ( 3,281 feet ) . a statement released by @entity131 , @entity0 's company , said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area , and that @entity0 had " commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain " before searching the area with a @entity141 autonomous underwater vehicle . @entity142 , the maritime museum director , said that , given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found , he was " 90 % sure " that the ship was the @entity11 . " i was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down . i have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered , but they all turned out not to be true . " @entity142 said @entity0 's team had been in contact with the museum about the ship 's potential location and its expedition . " it 's a wonderful discovery , if it 's true , as we have long been looking for the battleship , " he said . " it 's fateful that the discovery was made on the 70th anniversary of ( the end of ) @entity6 the memory of the war has been fading away after 70 years , and the survivors of the war are disappearing . it is very meaningful discovery and a good chance for us to remind ourselves about the war and its tragedy . " he added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100 % sure that the discovery is indeed the @entity11 . the @entity131 statement added that the team is " mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the @entity11 as a war grave and intend to work with the @entity5 government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with @entity5 traditions . " since leaving @entity1 , the company he co-founded in 1975 , billionaire @entity0 has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits . he is the owner of several @entity83 sports teams -- including the @entity192 -- and backed @entity193 , the prototype commercial spaceplane that won the 2004 @entity195 . his estimated net worth is $ 17.5 billion , according to @entity197 . @entity2 's @entity198 contributed to this report .
