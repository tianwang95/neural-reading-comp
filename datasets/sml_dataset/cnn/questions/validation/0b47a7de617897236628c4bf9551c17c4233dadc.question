( @entity5 ) its famous @entity0 -- the largest free - standing grandstand in @entity3 , with a capacity of 25,000 -- has helped enable @entity7 football club @entity6 achieve the rare feat of transcending the relationship between a club and its fans . so special is this club that 3,000 of its own supporters dipped into their pockets as part of a crowdfunding exercise , started in 2013 , to help finance a new documentary based on one of @entity6 's founding fathers . these @entity6 fans , along with sponsors , raised € 250,000 ( $ 265,000 ) in the process -- the biggest sum at the time ever raised for a film through crowdfunding in @entity7 . " this fan - club relationship is a legacy from our fathers , who made it clear that we have to engage and we have to fight for our club . it 's part of our story , " @entity31 , one of the film 's three creators , told @entity5 . one of those fathers , and seen as the most important , was @entity37 , who in 1909 along with 17 others helped found the club -- and it is " @entity41 geboren : @entity37 und die @entity42 des @entity6 " ( " born at the @entity43 : @entity37 and the cradle of @entity6 " ) that tells his story . founding fathers @entity55 and images are conjured up of back - to - back @entity7 @entity58 title wins in 2011 and 2012 , the @entity49 triumph of 1997 or how it became the first @entity7 side to win a @entity53 competition with the @entity54 in 1966 . without 21 - year - old @entity37 and his disciples , however , none of that success may have ever materialized . for it was those brave 18 that gathered inside a pub called @entity65 just off @entity6 's @entity66 , with the aim of establishing their own football club in response to the @entity72 chaplain @entity71 's refusal to allow his youth group members the chance to kick a ball around . @entity37 and co. managed to resist @entity71 's overtures and so " @entity79 " ( " @entity80 " ) was born . " when we started making the film i was aware of our story but not so deeply , " @entity81 says of a film inspired by a similar crowdfunding project dreamed up by @entity85 supporters in 2012 . " it 's so interesting -- one so deep and with so much drama . " " it 's also a love story , it has everything you need , " @entity31 adds , referring to @entity37 having originally dragged his friends to the city as he was in love with the pub owner 's daughter , who he would later go on to marry . " if you were to try to write something , it would be exactly the same story as this . " a legacy @entity37 's @entity107 today still runs through the club that he helped to establish . @entity6 president from 1910 to 1923 , @entity37 laid the foundations of a club which prides itself on harboring a real sense of involvement and belonging for its supporters . permitted to stay at home in @entity7 during @entity117 as he was the oldest son of the family and his father had died , @entity37 wrote postcards to those club members who were away fighting , while also helping to take care of their wives and children . @entity125 , @entity6 's maiden president and @entity37 's best friend , was one of those fighting , and he would go on to write what turned out to be the club 's first ever song during his time in the trenches -- part of that song is still included in one of @entity6 's official anthems , " @entity137 " ( " we are standing together " ) . " this was the beginning of the so - called ' @entity140 , ' where it was more than a club , " @entity31 says , recalling a term used by @entity37 . " we have always been democratic and i think he always wanted the club members to have rights and votes , and to engage . i think @entity37 would be proud of the club today . " the @entity140 @entity37 's " @entity140 " is not a term used officially by the club and its supporters now , but its meaning continues to resonate . with @entity6 dangerously close to bankruptcy just a decade ago , fans came together to do all they could for their club , while as well as donating to fund the new film , supporters also contributed old photographs to help shed light on @entity37 's story . " i thought it was a great idea to make the film by our own people so i donated , " @entity6 fan @entity164 , who also donated for his mother and brother , tells @entity5 . " we 've had so many more new members in recent years and it 's great to bring them our history because what is the future without the past ? " the film remembers many , many people , where we came from , which way we 've grown up -- it made me proud to be a part of it and it shows fans and supporters stand behind the club . " this relationship is no one - way street , though , with @entity6 in response offering up € 50,000 ( $ 53,000 ) towards the project , while providing it with valuable exposure via its social - network sites . all the money raised from the film will go into social projects in @entity6 -- historically an industrial and working - class area -- where the club was founded . " today 's fan engagement has partly come about from all those years ago with @entity37 , but also because @entity6 is located in a city that is very emotional when it comes to football , " @entity31 says . " @entity80 has always had fans that have traveled for the club and tried to struggle with the club officials and are engaged . it 's a typical @entity6 thing . " @entity203 @entity7 correspondent and @entity6 fan @entity202 adds : " the core of the fans are very close still and the club as well is close to the fans . " everyone still has the feeling they can do stuff and actually change things at the club . " ' struggle to survive ' boasting the highest average attendance in the world , as well as the @entity0 , there are not many more awe - inspiring sights in football than the @entity221 when @entity6 fans are in full voice . in an age when one bad performance from the likes of @entity227 or @entity228 can bring with it a chorus of boos from its supporters , @entity6 fans have stood by their team for the most part this season , despite relegation from the @entity58 having threatened a club that was @entity7 champion in 2012 . " we always need to struggle to survive in different periods , and i think maybe that 's a legacy from @entity37 's time , " @entity31 says of a club that was relegated in 1972 and narrowly escaped the same fate in 1986 . " the ups and downs make the club more exciting , and there have been so many extreme emotions in every direction . " i think it makes the good things much more enjoyable and wonderful because if you always win and are always top of the table it becomes boring . " when you are a @entity6 supporter you never know what you are going to get . " pride that sentiment most likely applied to @entity37 himself , whose body today lies buried in @entity6 following the club 's decision to move it into the area after originally being located 300 kilometers away in @entity265 . fifty - seven years after helping to form " @entity79 , " @entity37 found himself in @entity266 , having put aside his fear of flying aged 78 to watch his team beat @entity269 in the 1966 @entity54 final . " that was a very special moment for him -- he said it was a big moment for him and he was really proud , " @entity31 says of @entity37 , who died 13 years later at the age of 90 . " if you 're planning a club 57 years ago , and 57 years later you are top of @entity3 and you are the first @entity49 winner in @entity7 , that must be a fantastic moment . " born at the @entity43 : @entity37 and the cradle of @entity6 is released in @entity7 cinemas and on dvd on march 15
