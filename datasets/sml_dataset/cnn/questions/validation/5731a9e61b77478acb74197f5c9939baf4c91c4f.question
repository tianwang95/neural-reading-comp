( @entity2 ) " a picture of horror . " that 's how @entity5 foreign minister @entity4 described the site where a @entity9 @entity8 plane crashed in the @entity10 on tuesday . " the grief of the families and loved ones is immeasurable , " @entity4 said , after flying over the area in the @entity10 in southeastern @entity12 . " we must stand with them . we are all united in great grief . " departure : @entity20 , @entity21 , at 10:01 a.m. ( 26 minutes late ) destination : scheduled to land in @entity23 , @entity5 , at 11:39 a.m. passengers : 150 ( 144 passengers , six crew members ) airplane : @entity8 ( twin - jet ) airline : @entity9 ( budget airline owned by @entity30 ) flight distance : 726 miles last known tracking data : 10:38 a.m. last known speed : 480 mph last known altitude : 11,400 feet last known location : near @entity36 , @entity12 , in the @entity10 sources : @entity2 and flightaware.com @entity39 took off just after 10 a.m. tuesday from @entity20 , @entity21 , for @entity23 , @entity5 , with 144 passengers -- among them two babies -- and six crew members . it went down at 10:53 a.m. ( 5:53 a.m. et ) in a remote area near @entity36 in the @entity46 region . all aboard are presumed dead . helicopter crews found the airliner in pieces , none of them bigger than a small car , and human remains strewn for several hundred meters , according to @entity54 , a high - level official in the @entity46 region who is being briefed on the operation . authorities were not able to retrieve any bodies tuesday , with the frozen ground complicating the effort . wednesday may not be much easier , with snow in the forecast . @entity21 and @entity5 officials moved to join hundreds of @entity10 firefighters and police in the area , working together to help in the recovery effort and try to figure out exactly what happened . as of tuesday evening , there were few clues . one of the aircraft 's data recorders , the so - called black boxes , has been found , according to @entity10 interior minister @entity74 , but it was too early to tell what it would say about the crash . " we do n't know much about the flight and the crash yet , " @entity5 chancellor @entity79 said . " and we do n't know the cause . " relatives of those believed to be on the flight , fearing the worst , gathered at the @entity20 airport , where a crisis center was set up . @entity10 authorities set up a chapel near the crash site . @entity30 said the company will look after the relatives of those on board . " there will be a contact center established in @entity12 ; relatives who would like to take advantage of this will be transferred to the contact center at no cost -- and their accommodation paid for -- just as soon as the center has been established , " @entity30 said . those aboard included a " high number of @entity21 , @entity5 and @entity106 , " according to @entity21 's @entity104 . @entity9 ceo @entity107 said it 's believed 67 people , or nearly half those on the plane , are @entity5 citizens . @entity9 crash : who was on the plane ? sixteen students and two teachers from one @entity5 high school , called @entity118 , were among those booked on @entity39 , according to @entity120 , a municipal official in @entity121 , the town where the school is located . a crisis center has been established at the city hall in @entity121 , which is about 77 kilometers ( 48 miles ) north of @entity23 's airport . @entity107 confirmed the 16 students and two teachers were on the plane . @entity129 's mayor , @entity128 , said they had been heading home after taking part in a foreign exchange program . " the whole city is shocked , and we can feel it everywhere , " @entity128 said . a @entity138 citizen and a @entity139 -- the latter a resident of @entity20 -- were among those on the flight , according to those countries ' foreign ministries . two @entity146 and two @entity147 were also believed to be on board . @entity9 started in 2002 and was taken over by @entity30 seven years later as its low - cost airline , handling an increasing number of midrange flights around @entity152 . it was forced to cancel some flights tuesday because there were crews that did n't want to fly upon hearing news of the crash . the valley where the plane went down is long and snow - covered , and access is difficult , said the mayor of the nearby town of @entity164 , @entity165 . it was well populated in the 19th century but there are almost no people living there now , he said . it 's an out - of - the - way place with magnificent scenery , he said . the sports hall of a local school has been freed up to take in bodies of the victims of the plane crash , said @entity177 from the town hall of @entity180 - les - @entity46 village . @entity180 - les - @entity46 is about 10 kilometers from the crash site . mountain guide @entity182 told @entity184 the crash was in the area of the @entity187 , where there are peaks of nearly 3,000 meters ( 1.9 miles ) . it 's very snowy in the area and the weather is worsening , he said , which could complicate search and rescue efforts . responders may have to use skis to reach the crash site on the ground , he said . @entity199 , president of the tourism office at the @entity202 ski resort , said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened . " it was about 11 ( a.m. ) here . i was outside the garage , and we heard a strange noise , and at first we thought it was an avalanche , " she said . " something was wrong . ... we did n't know what . " a mountain guide who heard a plane fly at alarmingly low altitude shortly before the crash , @entity219 , said helicopters may be the only way to get to the crash site . according to the @entity224 , just under 16 % of aviation accidents occur during the cruise portion of a flight -- meaning after the climb and before descent . accidents are more common during takeoff and landing . the twin - engine @entity233 , which entered service in 1988 , is generally considered among the most reliable aircraft , aviation analyst @entity232 said . the captain of the crashed plane had flown for @entity9 for more than 10 years , and had more than 6,000 flight hours on this model of @entity8 . the plane itself dates to 1991 and was last checked in @entity23 on monday , according to @entity107 . so what happened ? @entity2 aviation analyst @entity244 said the plane 's speed is one clue . according to @entity9 , the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet , and then dropped for eight minutes . the plane lost contact with @entity10 radar at a height of approximately 6,000 feet . then it crashed . this could indicate that there was not a stall , but that the pilot was still controlling the plane to some extent , @entity244 said . had there been an engine stall , the plane would have crashed in a matter of minutes , she said . that small piece of information about the descent means that the pilot could have been trying to make an emergency landing , or that the plane was gliding with the pilot 's guidance , @entity244 said . a scenario where the plane was gliding is potentially more dangerous because wide fields for landing would be hard to come by in the mountains , she said . the crash spurred officials in several countries to offer their condolences and pledge solidarity and cooperation to help those affected and determine what happened . " our thoughts and our prayers are with our friends in @entity152 , especially the people of @entity5 and @entity21 , following the terrible airplane crash in @entity12 , " @entity287 president @entity286 told reporters . " it 's particularly heartbreaking because it apparently includes the loss of so many children , some of them infants . " @entity5 's @entity79 said she was sending two ministers to @entity12 on tuesday and would travel to the crash site on wednesday to see it for herself . " we have to think of the victims and their families and their friends , " she said . @entity5 foreign minister @entity4 said the @entity5 government had set up a crisis center in response to the " terrible news " and was in close contact with the @entity10 authorities . " in these difficult hours , our thoughts are with those who have to fear that their close ones are among the passengers and crew , " he said . @entity2 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 and @entity324 contributed to this report .
