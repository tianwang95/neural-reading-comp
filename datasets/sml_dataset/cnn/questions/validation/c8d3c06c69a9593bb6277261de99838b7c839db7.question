( @entity1 ) @entity0 city manager @entity0 resigned tuesday in the wake of a scathing @entity4 report . the report blames @entity0 , @entity6 , police and courts for abusive behavior that disproportionately targets @entity11 residents . " over the last several months i have done everything in my power to work with countless groups to bring about positive change and strengthen our community , " @entity0 wrote in his resignation letter . he continued : " during this time i have also worked closely with the @entity4 to identify opportunities to improve , and then moved quickly to implement its recommendations for change . " and while i certainly respect the work that the @entity4 recently performed in their investigation and report on the @entity25 , i must state clearly that my office has never instructed the police department to target @entity11 , nor falsify charges to administer fines , nor heap abuses on the backs of the poor . any inferences of that kind from the report are simply false . " @entity0 's resignation was announced the same day the @entity37 voted 7 - 0 on a mutual separation agreement with @entity0 . residents elect @entity37 members , who in turn appoint the city manager . the city manager directs and supervises all city departments , including the @entity44 . along with other officials , @entity0 was heavily criticized by the @entity4 report , which found that authorities in @entity0 frequently saw residents as " sources of revenue . " in fact , the city enjoyed so much success in issuing tickets and fines that @entity0 , population 21,000 , was ranked in the top eight of the 80 municipal courts in @entity58 by having more than $ 1 million in revenue in 2010 , the report said . in one march 2012 email , the captain of the patrol division reported to @entity0 that court collections the previous month reached $ 235,000 -- the first month collections exceeded $ 200,000 . the city manager reported the email to the @entity37 , congratulating police and court staff on their " great work , " the report said . when @entity0 court revenues exceeded $ 2 million for the whole of 2012 , the city manager responded to the police chief in an internal email : " awesome ! thanks ! " according to the federal report . the @entity4 's probe came after public outcry over the death of unarmed black teenager @entity80 , who was shot by @entity0 police officer @entity81 in august . @entity81 , who was not indicted on any charges , has resigned from the police department . but when @entity0 resident @entity85 defended @entity81 at tuesday 's @entity37 meeting , she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd . " i 'd like to say a lot of people in this room owe @entity81 an apology , " @entity85 said , prompting laughter by some in the audience . " the same justice report that you 're basing all your opinions on cleared him 100 % . " @entity1 's @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 contributed to this report .
