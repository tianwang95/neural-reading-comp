( @entity2 ) some viewers of the @entity1 on sunday night took to social media to vent about the opening monologue , saying one controversial joke by @entity6 crossed the line . @entity6 , the actor and musician who won an @entity9 for his portrayal of @entity11 , hosted the second annual awards show in @entity13 . " we got some groundbreaking performances , here too , tonight , " @entity6 said . " we got @entity17 , who will be doing some musical performances . he 's doing a his - and - her duet all by himself . " there have been reports that @entity23 , an @entity25 gold medalist , plans to transition from male to female . however , @entity23 has not spoken publicly about any such possibility . many television viewers took to social media to complain that the joke was offensive to people struggling with issues of gender and sexual identity . the hashtag # @entity36 remained a top trend monday . " @entity6 just made a terrible , disgusting joke about @entity17 's rumored transition on this trash awards show , " tweeted @ laurennostro . " seriously # @entity43 ? # @entity45 jokes ? " wrote @ @entity42 . " you 're disgusting , that 's not ok . it was n't funny , just mean spirited and lazy . " @entity6 's joke was n't the only part of the show that made headlines . pop princess @entity53 continued her recent hot streak by winning artist of the year and song of the year for her hit " @entity58 . " @entity53 also played guitar onstage while @entity60 sang her new song , " @entity62 . " and @entity63 received the @entity64 for his achievements as an entertainer . the former @entity68 heartthrob , who has earned critical praise and commercial success as a solo artist and an actor , said he was n't one of the cool kids growing up . " they called me different . they called me weird , " he said in accepting the award . " thankfully my mother taught me that being different was a good thing . that being different meant you could actually make a difference so i wan na thank my mom ... " in his monologue , @entity6 also took potshots at the " @entity90 " copyright - infringement battle and the health of a famous 1990s record executive . those jokes found more acceptance than the @entity23 quip . " @entity94 had the number one song , featuring @entity96 ( @entity96 ) and @entity97 , " @entity6 said , setting up for his punch line : " @entity94 just made $ 7.4 million just last week . he 's making beats in heaven . it 's crazy , " he joked . " he might be dead , but he ai n't dead broke . " @entity103 's children had sued @entity96 and @entity97 over the 2013 hit " @entity90 , " which jurors decided borrowed elements from @entity103 's soul classic " @entity107 . " the performers were ordered to pay $ 7.4 million for copyright damages and infringement . the crowd laughed again when @entity6 turned to @entity113 founder @entity112 , who has been charged with murder in the hit - and - run death of a man run over by a truck . " he will not be here tonight , " @entity6 said of @entity112 . " he founded @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , and now he needs a seeing - eye dog . " @entity112 collapsed in court recently , as a result of ongoing health issues , after a judge set his bail at $ 25 million in the murder case . he hit his head during the fall , knocking himself out .

" he 's doing a his - and - her duet all by himself , " @placeholder said of @entity17
