@entity1 ( @entity2 ) cabinet - maker @entity0 has just put the finishing touches to a coffin ; built of highly - polished , honey - colored @entity6 oak and yew , it has been a labor of love , pondered over and painstakingly crafted . because this is n't any ordinary commission : the casket will be the final resting place of one of @entity0 's distant relatives , @entity15 , who died more than 500 years ago . " it is a unique privilege , " says @entity16 - born @entity0 , whose dna was used to establish the identity of the @entity19 , found buried beneath a car parking lot in the city of @entity22 in august 2012 . " there 's a wonderful serendipity in a sense that someone involved in the identification of the remains should happen to be furniture maker who can do this . " when you 're working away you just focus on joining two bits of wood , but at the end of the day when you stand back and think ' i 'm building @entity15 's coffin , ' it 's incredible . " @entity0 says he 's been on an " extraordinary journey " in the two - and - a - half years since he gave a dna swab to genetics specialist @entity42 on the off chance that experts searching for the burial place of his seventeen - times great - uncle might strike it lucky . back then even the man in charge of the dig , archaeologist @entity48 , did n't expect to find anything -- he told colleagues he 'd " eat his hat " if they turned up the long - lost @entity19 's remains . " when we were planning the project , i never made any secret of the fact i thought it very unlikely we 'd be successful , " @entity48 told @entity2 . " the chances of hitting the right spot were very slim . " call it a fluke , or call it fate , but as it turned out they hit the right spot almost immediately : @entity15 's skeleton was found on the very first day of the dig , in the first trench dug by the team . at the time , all the experts knew was that they 'd found a set of leg bones , chopped off at the feet by building work at some point in the intervening centuries . it was n't until days later , as archaeologist @entity80 carefully exhumed the rest of the skeleton that she spotted the distinct curve of its spine , and the devastating damage medieval weapons had left on its skull . for @entity90 , founder of the " @entity95 " project , who stood watching with bated breath as the bones were uncovered , the discovery was a vindication of the years she had spent trying to get people to search for the @entity19 's remains -- and to look again at his reputation . say the name @entity15 to many people , and the image which will spring to mind is that of @entity105 's villain , hunchbacked and murderous , who met a grisly end on the battlefield at @entity108 after killing his nephews , the @entity110 . years of research had convinced @entity112 of two things : firstly , that his remains lay underneath a car park , in what had once been the @entity118 ' monastery , and secondly , that he was much - maligned , the victim of bitter @entity121 propaganda after his death . two - and - a - half years on , @entity112 believes the discovery -- which proved her first theory to be correct -- and the scientific research carried out since , have forced a rethink of @entity15 's story . " as a writer my view of @entity15 has always been that he was a very complex , very conflicted , very flawed individual -- that 's the human condition : we are all flawed , complex , conflicted -- but there was something heroic about him , he was courageous on and off the battlefield , " she explains . she says dna evidence that the @entity19 was blue eyed and fair haired -- in contrast to portraits and written descriptions which painted him " as a hunchback , with a withered arm and a crippled gait , with ' evil ' dark eyes and hair " -- had " blow [ n ] the mythology out of the window . " " it makes people question , drop their preconceptions , forget their assumptions , and go back to the beginning , " she says . this weekend , @entity15 's skeleton will leave the laboratory at the @entity158 , where it has been kept since it was found , and be taken back to @entity108 , scene of his death in 1485 , for a commemoration ceremony , before being returned to @entity22 ahead of its reburial next week . and while his body last made that trip slung unceremoniously over the back of a horse , this time the journey will be done in style : carried in the coffin made by his great - nephew . inside , the smaller bones from his hands and feet will be tucked into linen bags -- each one decorated with a rose , representing the @entity176 , @entity15 's family -- sewn by children from @entity22 's @entity15 @entity179 . " i feel very proud because i 've never made a bag for a king before , " said @entity180 , who helped make the pouches . " it 's like i 'm a servant doing something for a @entity19 , " added his classmate @entity184 . lead conservation specialist @entity187 -- who previously helped to restore the @entity188 in @entity189 -- will be the last person to set eyes on the skeleton , as he welds the ossuary inside the casket shut . well - wishers are expected to line the route as the cortege winds through the @entity198 countryside , stopping at several churches along the way for prayers and religious services before making its way back to @entity205 , near the site of the archaeological dig , where a new tomb has been built for the @entity19 . historian @entity209 , who discovered the genealogical link between @entity15 and @entity0 , says it is important that the @entity19 's @entity213 beliefs are recognized in the ceremonies . @entity209 , who shares @entity15 's faith , has had a rosary , featuring the white @entity176 rose and a crucifix like one thought to have been owned by @entity15 's mother , made to be placed inside the coffin . for @entity112 , the procession and celebrations are key to repairing past damage . " the ethos and aim of the project was to give @entity15 what he did n't get in 1485 , " she says . " the reason we wanted to do that was to recognize what went on in the past but not repeat it , to make peace with history . "

bones will be buried in a coffin made by @entity15 's descendant , @placeholder
