( @entity2 ) astronauts on the @entity3 completed a spacewalk sunday despite the appearance of water inside an astronaut 's helmet , @entity0 reported . in a tweet , the space agency said astronaut @entity11 experienced water inside his helmet , just as he did wednesday , but " it 's a known issue ; no concern . " the spacewalk lasted five hours and 38 minutes , @entity0 said . " crews have now spent a total of 1,171 hours and 29 minutes conducting space station assembly and maintenance during 187 spacewalks , " the agency said in a release . @entity0 previously said the suit worn by @entity0 astronaut @entity11 has a history of " sublimator water carryover . " water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk , causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet , @entity0 said . @entity0 said @entity3 managers had " a high degree of confidence " in the suit . on the upcoming spacewalk , @entity39 and @entity40 installed antennas to provide data to visiting vehicles and deploy 400 feet of cable along the edge of the station . @entity11 said he first noticed traces of fluid and dampness in his helmet wednesday while he was waiting for the crew lock cabin to repressurize . he and @entity40 had been outside the space station for nearly seven hours working on the station 's robotic arm and performing some maintenance . @entity39 immediately alerted fellow astronaut @entity57 about the water , and she alerted @entity59 in @entity60 . @entity57 helped @entity39 out of his helmet and examined it . she confirmed the presence of moisture , mostly in the helmet absorption pad , or @entity65 , describing it as " wet and cold . " at the request of @entity59 , @entity66 used a syringe to draw as much water as he could from the top of the helmet . water had collected in the white plastic at the top and around both ear cups . @entity66 estimated there was 15 milliliters of water in the helmet . that 's a far cry from the amount of water that accumulated in @entity83 's suit during a spacewalk in july 2013 . between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet , prompting fears @entity83 could drown in his own helmet . the spacewalk was cut short , and @entity0 implemented some changes to its suits , including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets . there was another intrusion of water into the helmet during another spacewalk on december 24 , 2013 . @entity0 commentator @entity101 said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as wednesday 's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock , the area from which astronauts enter and exit @entity3 while in space .
