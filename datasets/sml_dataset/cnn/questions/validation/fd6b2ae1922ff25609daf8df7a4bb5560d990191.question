( @entity0 ) a teenage @entity2 jihadist suspected of having carried out an @entity4 suicide attack developed a hatred for the @entity6 over the @entity8 and @entity9 wars , before settling on radical @entity10 as a vehicle for " violent global revolution , " according to his purported blog . @entity14 , an 18 - year - old student from @entity15 , appears to have documented his path to radicalization and his experiences in @entity4 - held territory in a blog , titled " from the eyes of a @entity22 : an @entity2 @entity22 in the land of the @entity24 . " the blog has been deleted , but a cached version remains available online . @entity0 could not independently verify the blog 's authenticity , but the biographical details detailed on the blog match @entity14 's . one of the final posts on the blog , which is credited to " @entity33 , " purports to have been posted on january 13 , as the author was " preparing to sacrifice my life for @entity10 in @entity36 . " the @entity2 government said wednesday it was working to confirm reports that @entity14 had carried out a suicide attack on behalf of @entity4 , after the terror group claimed an " @entity33 " had been killed in a car bombing during an offensive in the city of @entity36 . the claims were made along with a picture that appeared to be of @entity14 , referred to as " @entity33 , " apparently prior to carrying out the mission . the blogger describes having a " very comfortable " upbringing as the youngest of six in the @entity15 suburbs , where he was raised an atheist , excelled in his studies and " dreamed of becoming a political journalist . " he describes how his older siblings educated him on various subjects , and how his brother 's instruction on international politics held a special resonance for him , particularly after the september 11 attacks . " being just five years old at the time of the attacks ... my knowledge of the operation was basically non-existent . despite this , i was immediately drawn to the topics of @entity68 and ' islamic terrorism ' , " he wrote . " it was from here that my research into @entity68 ... and groups with similar ideologies worldwide began . i spent every day researching online and reading the books i had begun collecting . " the blogger writes that it was his reading on the wars in @entity8 and @entity9 , and abuses committed by occupying forces , " that gave birth to my disdain for the @entity79 and its allies , including @entity2 . it was also the start of my respect for the mujahideen that would only grow to develop into a love of @entity10 and ultimately bring me here to the @entity90 . " eventually , he wrote , he came to view democracy as " nothing but a system of lies and deception , " one which " focuses heavily on providing the people with so - called freedom " but " throws celebrities and false reality into the spotlight to distract the people from what is really going on in the world . " the wars " signaled the beginning of my complete hatred and opposition to the entire system @entity2 and the majority of the world was based upon , " he wrote . " it was also the moment i realised that violent global revolution was necessary to eliminate this system of governance and that ... i would likely be killed in this struggle . " while the blogger said he had come to the conclusion that democracy was " something that can only and must be destroyed by violent revolution , " he wrote , he " was never quite sure " what should replace it . " socialism ? communism ? ? @entity129 ? ? ? " he wrote . eventually , as his interest in jihadist groups deepened at about the time of the @entity133 , he settled on @entity10 . " it was @entity10 that for me stood out as easy to understand and was shockingly consistent with established historical and scientific facts , " he wrote . following a stretch in which he turned his back on his growing extremist beliefs , which he described as " one of the most shameful periods of my life , " the blogger wrote that he began to try to find a contact to help him join @entity144 or @entity145 , two @entity147 groups fighting in @entity148 . his attempts were unsuccessful . while he had initially rejected @entity4 after " falling for the many lies being spread against them , " he wrote that he began speaking to their members online , and , after witnessing their military successes , developed a desire to join the group . eventually , he managed to find a contact who promised to get him into @entity4 territory . worried that his plot to leave @entity2 might be foiled by authorities , the blogger wrote that he developed his " @entity177 , " collecting materials for what he envisaged as a " string of bombings across @entity15 , targeting foreign consulates and political / military targets as well as grenade and knife attacks on shopping centers and cafes and culminating with myself detonating a belt of explosives amongst the kuffar . " @entity179 police confirmed wednesday that chemicals that could be used to make an explosive device had been found in a search of his family 's home in the @entity15 suburb of @entity187 . the blogger wrote that he abandoned his plans for an attack in @entity15 after realizing that buying bomb - making chemicals could draw the attention of authorities and ruin his bid to join @entity4 . he did not reveal how he had been able to enter @entity4 territory , but said that on entering the @entity4 - held @entity148 city of @entity197 , he " felt a joy i had never experienced before . " in another blog post , entitled " being white in the @entity90 : the abolition of racism " he wrote approvingly that the " @entity90 has been successful in eliminating racism and in building the world 's only true multi-ethnic state . " he said he signed up for a " martyrdom operation , " or suicide attack , in @entity207 , @entity9 , which failed , before registering to undertake another in @entity36 , where he was " waiting for my turn to stand before @entity210 . " @entity212 , an expert on radicalization at the @entity214 , said that @entity14 " blew away the profile of what most people think of when they think of people who are going to support the @entity90 . " @entity219 and middle class , reportedly bullied at school and vulnerable following the loss of his mother to cancer , he more easily fit the profile of a school shooter than an @entity10 terrorist , he said . " what it does show us is that there are a whole range of profiles , " he said . @entity14 's aunt has linked the teen 's troubles to the loss of his mother , while a former classmate at @entity15 's @entity239 described him as shy . @entity212 said @entity14 's case was also notable in that he did not appear to have been " groomed " by terror recruiters -- indeed , he wrote of initially struggling to make contacts among @entity10 extremists -- and had radicalized himself through his own readings . " the pm here said @entity14 was brainwashed -- i do n't think he was brainwashed . he was very calculated in what he did and documented it quite clearly , " said @entity212 . in one of the blog posts , the blogger says that the warm welcome he and other foreign fighters had received in the @entity90 disproved " the @entity2 government 's laughable claim that we are used as ' cannon fodder ' . " but @entity212 said his @entity14 's ultimate fate in a suicide mission was typical for foreign fighters in his position . he believed that in knowingly signing up for this fate , on two separate occasions , @entity14 had been seeking the kind of recognition and achievement that , as a vulnerable teen , he had been denied at home . " he wanted that ' religious prize ' , " he said . @entity0 's @entity269 contributed to this report .
