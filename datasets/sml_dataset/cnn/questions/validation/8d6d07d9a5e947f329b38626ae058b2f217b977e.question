( @entity0 ) @entity2 's follow - up to " @entity3 " is getting a lot of attention , not all of it good . her new @entity9 series , " the @entity10 , " is being criticized online for dealing in offensive humor and stereotypes . the show , which had been picked up by @entity14 but ultimately dropped , stars @entity15 ( " bridesmaids , " " @entity22 " ) as an upbeat woman stuck in the 1990s after being kidnapped by a doomsday cult leader : not exactly fodder for humor , on its surface . after she 's released from an @entity25 bunker , @entity23 moves to @entity26 to start a life , and much of the humor comes from her misunderstanding of the modern world , her seventh - grade education and her relationships with a diverse cast of pals . since its debut , @entity35 has declared that the show has a " major race problem , " and others criticized its treatment of an @entity43 character named @entity44 . @entity45 says that the critics " are n't wrong ... but they are missing the point . " " @entity2 's high - wire act is all about the alchemy of making it ok to laugh at big , heavy issues -- like kidnapped women , the experience of undocumented @entity57 immigrants , and people with @entity60 ancestry passing as white -- by skimming over them with a light touch , " @entity49 wrote on @entity45 . the @entity64 's @entity63 wrote that she once hid her @entity60 past , just like @entity23 's employer , a wealthy woman played by @entity68 . @entity63 said that watching the show made her uncomfortable but at the same time praised @entity2 's " genius " writing . but @entity76 , who plays @entity23 's black gay roommate , @entity75 ( whom some have called a stereotype ) , says the whole controversy is " ridiculous . " he told the @entity80 , " i just find it hilarious that people are trying to arrest us for doing the opposite of what everyone thinks we 're doing . " the show is certainly not afraid to go right up to the edge with jokes about race , age , class , gender and sexuality . consider these biting one - liners and bits of dialogue . 1 . " @entity98 ; @entity100 woman also found . " an onscreen news graphic zings the media after @entity23 and her bunker - mates are freed . 2 . @entity104 : " my first wife ... " @entity63 : " ... turned 50 . and i would never do that to you . " @entity23 's wealthy employers , @entity104 and @entity109 , consider their marital difficulties . 3 . " we came all this way in the great iron sky eagle . i 'm kidding . i know what planes are ; i was in the @entity116 . " @entity63 's father , @entity117 , explains how he and @entity63 's mother , both @entity119 , traveled to @entity26 to see their daughter . 4 . " you know @entity122 lies to little girls . stepmothers are n't scary , and nannies are n't magical , and dwarves do not let you sleep in their house without expecting something . " @entity130 , the spoiled teen stepdaughter of @entity23 's wealthy employer , offers up a cynical take on the new nanny 's @entity134 ( or emotionally stunted ) attitude . 5 . " well , i had a cellphone , @entity139 , obvs , but i lost it at the zoo . a monkey took it , and she would n't give it back . yeah , @entity139 , the monkey was a woman . women can be anything these days . " @entity23 was underground as cell phone use exploded -- but she hides that truth from most people , especially the vengeful @entity152 . 6 . " my dad can not find out about this , please ! he 'll kill me ! or marry me off to one of his @entity157 friends ! " @entity152 begs for a break like any teen but gives a glimpse at the life of a 1 % adolescent . 7 . " i 'm not even gon na know what box to check on the hate crime form . " such is the life of @entity75 , @entity23 's roommate , a gay black man from @entity167 , trying to make an acting career in @entity26 . ( warning : the following video is not suitable for kids , or work . ) 8 . " straight guys can be vegetarians . @entity174 was a vegetarian . " @entity176 , @entity23 's colleague and potential love interest , defends his diet in the most awkward way . 9 . " yeah , it 's real popular now , like taking pictures of your food or being biracial . " @entity184 , @entity23 's closest friend from her days in the bunker , offers swift commentary on how the world has changed in the 15 years she was away . 10 . @entity23 : " @entity44 is the name of the @entity57 guy in my class . he 's good at math. " @entity75 : " that 's racist ! " @entity23 : " but he is good at math. " @entity75 : " i do n't make the rules . " @entity23 and @entity75 have a conversation about race , as if over cups of @entity201 coffee . 11 . @entity203 : " i will not bury another beautiful black man . you know my dear husband @entity205 was killed in our very own apartment . " @entity75 : " yes , i 've heard this story before . " @entity203 : " he got up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night , and on his way back to bed , he was shot in the face . " @entity75 : " by you , @entity203 . " @entity203 : " well , it was dark out , and a black guy was trying to get in bed with me . it was the ' 70s ! " @entity203 , @entity23 and @entity75 ' loony landlord , schools her young tenants on race relations of past and present .
