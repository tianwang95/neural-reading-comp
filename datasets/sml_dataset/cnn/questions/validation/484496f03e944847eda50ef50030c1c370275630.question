@entity2 ( @entity1 ) @entity0 who have gleefully watched @entity5 infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own . as the party works to retake control of the @entity11 in 2016 , democrats are looking at a @entity11 landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time . it 's a big shift from recent years when @entity5 , riven by long - standing ideological fault lines , faced divisive and attention - grabbing primaries , usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots . memorably , in 2010 and 2012 , the fights were so damaging that @entity5 failed to pick up winnable @entity11 seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates . democrats , for the most part , have not had to face the same problem . but that might be changing . while the fields of candidates are still taking shape , a platoon of @entity0 are mulling @entity11 bids in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 . while many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns , none possess the kind of field - clearing star power that could help @entity0 avoid a primary bonanza , and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity . @entity5 primary battles are n't going anywhere in 2016 , and on the presidential level , @entity0 continue to line up behind @entity56 as their nominee , without a whiff a serious primary challenge . but there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the @entity11 , where the question is whether @entity0 will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights , jeopardizing the party 's hopes of regaining control of the the @entity69 . " the great irony of @entity0 celebrating fissures amongst @entity5 in recent years is that historically they 're much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the @entity5 , " said @entity70 , a former top strategist to @entity71 senate leader @entity71 . " now we 're watching several years of pent - up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their @entity11 chances . " @entity0 scoff at the idea , claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a @entity11 win against the many @entity5 up for re-election next year . of the nine @entity11 seats rated as toss - up or competitive the @entity86 , seven of them are held by @entity5 elected in the @entity75 wave of 2010 . @entity0 need a net gain of five seats to take back the @entity11 . " unfortunately for the numerous vulnerable @entity5 senators , there are no @entity96 here , and there is n't a single state on the map with a @entity93 primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state , " said @entity92 , the @entity93 's communications director . @entity105 , of course , was the @entity5 nominee in @entity106 in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about " legitimate rape . " last cycle , @entity92 said , @entity0 witnessed hotly contested @entity11 primaries in @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 . all of those fights were in blue states , of course . but none of them resulted in a november loss for @entity0 . republicans , though , are hoping to breathe life into the narrative , especially with @entity93 primaries brewing in the competitive states of @entity37 and @entity36 . " democrats are facing messy primaries in key @entity11 races across the country , and there does n't seem to be any end in sight , " said @entity126 , communications director for the @entity127 . " the infighting is so bad that it 's not just limited to candidates in key races , but is even playing out between @entity138 and the @entity93 in @entity2 . " the most crowded lane , for now , appears to be in @entity38 , where five - term sen. @entity140 is retiring . in a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections , the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of @entity0 in @entity147 eyeing higher office . with the exception of @entity151 @entity150 , nearly every @entity152 in @entity38 's eight - member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the @entity11 seat . @entity158 president @entity157 and @entity160 mayor @entity159 have also been floated as contenders . despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates , the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party 's play - it - safe establishment and its restive liberal wing . @entity138 , the @entity93 leader in the @entity11 , declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed rep. @entity170 for the seat , a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner . the @entity93 , however , has not picked a side in the race . progressive groups , meanwhile , have championed a known figure from their community : rep. @entity180 , who joined the race last week vowing to protect @entity181 and @entity182 , " no ifs ands buts or willing - to - considers . " that was seen as a poke at @entity170 , who said in 2012 he was " willing to consider " entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations . but even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities , there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder @entity93 hopes in @entity38 , which has n't seen a @entity5 senator since @entity198 in 1987 . and @entity198 , a civil rights advocate and skeptic of @entity201 , was one of the most liberal members of the @entity5 . @entity5 are also hoping for @entity93 carnage in @entity36 , where sen. @entity204 is up for re-election . national democrats have endorsed former gov. @entity207 for the nomination , but the news did not force @entity210 , an up - and - coming 30 - year - old @entity211 city councilman , out of the race . @entity0 are skeptical that @entity213 can raise the kind of money to compete against @entity207 and @entity204 , but if he does , his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73 - year old @entity207 . in an interview , @entity210 spoke critically of @entity204 , calling him " a 25 - year creature of @entity2 " who is " out of touch " with @entity36 . but the next - generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about @entity207 's age . " i fit the mold for new leadership , " @entity210 told @entity1 in an interview , careful to note his admiration for @entity207 and stressing that he is running against @entity204 . " if you put together 100 people into the @entity11 , would n't you want at least one person from the largest generation in @entity234 history , the most technologically savvy generation in @entity234 history ? " @entity210 asked . " how can we invest in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles ? " as in @entity38 , there appear to be no major early - stage differences between @entity207 and @entity210 on the issues , which again suggests that the @entity93 primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else . with a presidential election on the ballot , increased voter turnout is expected to give @entity0 a lift in the general election . " there is an ideological reason for running , but let 's not separate that from a path to victory , " said @entity254 , editor of the @entity255 . " primaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity . @entity0 have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle , specifically in @entity38 . the @entity93 nomination is incredibly valuable because @entity38 is a @entity93 state . lots of candidates see paths to victory and think , ' why not me ? why not now ? ' " and while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines , the contests are not necessarily damaging , @entity254 said . " crowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory , " he said . " that does n't mean that a party ca n't win . " @entity283 , a @entity5 consultant who worked on several top tier @entity11 races in 2014 , said the primaries might boost @entity0 . " some of those primaries will animate elements of their base , including some donors , more than the general elections , " he said . but @entity283 said the rush of primary activity for @entity0 does not compare to the pitched @entity75 - versus - establishment battles that have roiled his party for years . " i do n't see that happening with @entity0 as much as it does with @entity5 since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals , " he said . " there 's no such thing as a centrist @entity152 anymore , so there wo n't be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries . "

a platoon of @entity0 are mulling @entity11 bids in @entity36 , @placeholder , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41
