( @entity2 ) @entity1 's star - studded attacking force might be struggling to fire , but @entity5 coach @entity4 has no such problems with his wealth of talent up front . sunday 's 6 - 1 demolition of @entity10 put the @entity12 side one point above @entity1 at the top of @entity16 's @entity15 , with @entity17 setting more records as he netted a hat - trick while fellow forward @entity20 also scored twice . even without suspended @entity22 star @entity21 -- the third prong of @entity5 's striking line -- @entity4 was able to happily reflect on a result that fully rubbed salt in @entity1 wounds following saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat at @entity29 . " we 're elated , but the objective is to be leading at the end of the season . i already said that everybody could lose a game , so we have to keep playing well and win every match , " he said . " it 's heavy having to win every single match . each game is more important than the last . " by contrast , @entity1 coach @entity40 is feeling the strain after also dropping points last weekend against @entity44 . " there is no link - up play , our play is too based around individual play , we need another way of attacking , with faster play and fewer touches , " said the @entity45 , who must rouse his troops for tuesday 's @entity49 last - 16 , second - leg tie at home to @entity51 . " it is quite confusing to see what we 're doing at the moment in attack . the ball does n't move around quickly . " while @entity1 's front trio of top scorer @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 are struggling to match their form from the first half of this season , @entity5 's star men are moving into menacing mode ahead of the rival teams ' " @entity77 " clash at the @entity75 in a fortnight . @entity17 's 32nd career hat - trick is a record for a @entity16 club player , and took him past @entity66 as the @entity15 leader on 24 trebles . the @entity84 star also drew level with the @entity87 captain as the @entity16 league 's top scorer this season on 30 goals . it 's the sixth successive season in which he has topped 40 goals , with 41 from 38 games so far this campaign . @entity20 has now scored six goals in his last four games , and 13 from 26 overall appearances since joining from @entity101 club @entity100 after a @entity102 that ended in a lengthy ban for his bite on @entity107 's @entity106 . " @entity20 and @entity17 are having more and more chemistry , and today we all saw what they bring to the team , " @entity4 said . " i like ( @entity114 ) @entity113 wherever he plays on the field . he always knows what to do with the ball and is one of the best signings we 've ever had . " " ( @entity121 ) @entity120 has always known how to score , above all on set plays . it 's a perfect solution for games when our opponents collapse defensively . " both teams had a player sent off in front of a crowd of over 87,000 , @entity5 's best this season : @entity10 defender @entity133 for a foul on @entity20 in the 55th minute that allowed @entity17 to make it 3 - 0 with a retaken penalty ; and @entity137 for tripping @entity138 , who also netted the resulting spot - kick . @entity5 's 20th win from 26 league games put the club seven points clear of third - placed @entity144 after the defending champion 's 1 - 1 home draw with fourth - placed @entity147 later sunday . @entity148 put @entity144 ahead in the first half but @entity150 headed an equalizer with 12 minutes left , while @entity147 teammate @entity152 received two late yellow cards . sixth - placed @entity44 beat @entity154 4 - 0 , while @entity155 beat @entity156 1 - 0 in a mid-table clash . in @entity107 , second - placed @entity158 missed a chance to put pressure on leader @entity161 after being held 0 - 0 at struggling @entity163 on sunday . it left @entity166 's team eight points adrift of @entity161 , which hosts @entity168 on monday . third - placed @entity169 also drew , blowing a two - goal lead against @entity171 as @entity172 and @entity173 , with an 87th - minute penalty , canceled out second - half goals by @entity176 and @entity177 . in @entity179 , @entity178 moved up to fourth with a 3 - 0 win at @entity181 as @entity183 striker @entity182 scored two late goals after a 73rd - minute opener from @entity187 defender @entity186 . in @entity189 , @entity188 restored a one - point lead at the top of the table with a 5 - 1 win at @entity194 , as young midfielder @entity195 scored twice . in @entity101 , @entity196 side @entity100 faces an @entity198 replay after being held 0 - 0 by second - tier @entity199 .
