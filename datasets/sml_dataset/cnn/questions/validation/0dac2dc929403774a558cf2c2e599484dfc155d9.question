( @entity5 ) if you have n't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to @entity4 , chances are you will soon . the livestreaming app was the " @entity8 sweetheart " this year , despite having only launched on february 27 . it 's been adding users rapidly ever since -- even @entity11 is streaming his life using @entity4 . as part of @entity5 's @entity17 series , @entity14 correspondent @entity13 reached out to @entity4 's @entity18 with some questions . and he agreed to answer them -- on @entity4 , of course . you can see a few moments from the chat in the video above . @entity18 is actually the co-founder and chief executive of @entity27 , a livestreaming company with many tentacles . but recently @entity18 decided to dedicate his entire team to work on @entity4 after the app 's popularity exploded . still , @entity18 said , he does n't consider the app an " instant startup " per se . it took years of work to reach this moment , he said . the half - hour chat between @entity18 and @entity13 was informative and entertaining . several people said it broke their record for the longest @entity41 stream they had ever watched . we heard more about @entity4 and @entity18 's vision for the future ; for example , he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms , like @entity48 or @entity49 . @entity18 also revealed who he 'd like most to join in the fun . startup wannabes also got some great advice from this successful entrepreneur . launching a new business or product is difficult , and requires flexibility , @entity18 said . entrepreneurs need people they can trust -- who wo n't be afraid to call " b.s . " on a bad idea . for more , check out our @entity63 .
