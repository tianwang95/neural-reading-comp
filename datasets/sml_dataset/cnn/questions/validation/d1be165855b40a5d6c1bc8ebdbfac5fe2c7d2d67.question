@entity1 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) while @entity2 government and allied forces were on the defensive friday in @entity6 , they remained on the offensive in @entity8 -- trying to win over not only the strategic city , but the hearts and minds of its nearby residents . @entity2 forces steadily bombarded the last part of @entity1 still controlled by @entity16 , with fighting described by one wounded man as intense . still , even as it fends off this assault , the militant group continues with its barbaric tactics . " yesterday , bodies floated down the ( @entity24 ) @entity23 from the hospital , " said @entity21 , an eight - year @entity2 military veteran . " they were people from @entity1 executed by @entity16 . " the @entity2 military is joined by some @entity29 fighters and a predominantly @entity31 militia , working together to retake the city best known to most westerners as the hometown of former dictator @entity35 . they are working on not just winning the battle , but securing the peace . members of the @entity41 organization , a powerful @entity31 armed group , handed out food and supplies friday to residents of the @entity29 village of @entity47 , whose 30 families have been holed up the last 10 months amid the fighting . the village 's leader , @entity50 , said the @entity31 fighters ' efforts were working . " they 're good , " @entity50 said . " if someone is sick , they 'll take them to the doctor , even at 2 or 3 in the morning . " if it were n't for them , @entity16 would have slaughtered us . " in june , @entity1 fell to @entity16 , which has conquered large areas of @entity2 and @entity62 and claimed them as part of its @entity65 caliphate . there have several attempts to take it back since then , all of them failures . the latest push began this month , involving around 30,000 fighters . by thursday , the government controlled about 75 % of the besieged city , with about 150 holdout @entity16 fighters controlling the rest , said @entity78 , commander of the @entity80 militia . there was no independent confirmation of such a significant advance by the @entity2 forces . but they have been making progress in recent days . that includes gaining control of @entity89 , a few blocks south of the presidential palace , on wednesday . the goal is that , if @entity2 and allied forces can take @entity1 , then they 'll have more realistic hope of similarly winning back @entity96 -- a city that 's nearly 10 times bigger . yet , even if @entity16 is losing ground in @entity1 , that does n't mean it 's not a dangerous , destructive force elsewhere . case in point is happening about 100 miles south of @entity1 in @entity6 , which the extremist group began assaulting on wednesday . @entity105 , deputy head of the @entity107 provincial council , has said officials believe the @entity6 assault " is an @entity16 response to the @entity1 operation . " more than 40 @entity2 soldiers died when @entity16 blew up the @entity2 army headquarters near @entity6 in @entity2 's western @entity107 province , an @entity107 provincial leader told @entity3 on friday . @entity16 fighters there dug a tunnel underneath the army headquarters and detonated hundreds of homemade bombs , @entity120 , the head of the @entity121 , said thursday . the headquarters are located in the @entity124 area , just 4 kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) north of @entity6 . @entity120 denied reports that the @entity127 - led coalition had bombed the headquarters . so , too , did the @entity127 government , with its @entity131 embassy stating friday that no coalition aircraft were even in the area a statement released early friday by the @entity127 - led coalition against @entity16 said the @entity2 security forces had successfully repelled the @entity16 attack on @entity6 , despite coming under attack from several directions . " the successful defense of @entity6 by @entity143 is another example of their increasing ability to defeat @entity147 in multiple locations and prevent the terrorist group from gaining ground , " said lt. gen. @entity139 , the coalition force 's commander , using another name for @entity16 . " the @entity143 continues to hold terrain in some locations while making gains in others . " in an audio message posted thursday , @entity16 spokesman @entity155 called reports of victories by coalition members against the extremist group " delusional and fake . " he spoke of the coalition 's use of fighter jets , heavy artillery and tanks , saying it is a " nightmare and will go eventually . " @entity3 's @entity167 reported near @entity1 in @entity2 . @entity3 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .
