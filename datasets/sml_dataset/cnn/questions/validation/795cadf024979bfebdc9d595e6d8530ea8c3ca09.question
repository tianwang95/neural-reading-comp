( @entity1 ) @entity0 has ruled @entity2 before , as one of a line of military strongmen who dominated the country between 1966 and 1999 . a military coup brought @entity0 to power in late 1983 -- closing a brief period of popular rule by @entity11 -- and another military coup ousted him from power in august 1985 . @entity0 's 20 - month rule was known for what he described as a " war on indiscipline , " a tough regime which some say was marred by human rights abuses . the 72 - year - old retired major general 's experience as a military ruler has been viewed as a plus by some and a minus by others in present - day @entity2 , where the government has been locked in a deadly battle with the militant group @entity30 . this year alone , the extremists have killed at least 1,000 civilians , @entity31 says . the ongoing violence in the @entity35 has put security -- along with corruption and the economy -- at the top of the election agenda . prior to this year 's polls in march , @entity42 , a documentary filmmaker and analyst on @entity45 affairs , told @entity1 that voters would opt for whoever could make @entity2 feel safe . " many @entity48 will not forget ( @entity0 ) was a military leader , during a dictatorship , " @entity42 said . " or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism . " @entity0 has campaigned as a born - again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime , while stressing that @entity2 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . " it 's a question of security . whether i was a former military officer or a politician through and through , when there is insecurity of this scale in the country , that takes the priority , " he said from his campaign plane . in another interview with @entity72 in february , @entity0 blamed president @entity74 's government for repeated setbacks in the fight against extremists . " the misappropriation of resources provided by the government for weapons means the @entity2 military is unable to beat @entity30 , " he said . asked by @entity72 about abuses allegedly committed during his own previous leadership , @entity0 said there was " a degree of accuracy " in the claims . but he said he had ruled @entity2 as part of a military administration . " when that military administration came under my leadership , we suspended -- as a military then -- part of that constitution that we felt would be difficult for us to operate and as also a consensus , " he said . " i think i 'm being judged harshly as an individual that what happened during a military administration can be extended under a multiparty democratic system . " @entity0 's campaign was fiercely anti-corruption . he ran under the slogan of " new broom , " and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead - up to the vote . the 2015 presidential race was @entity0 's fourth attempt at leadership since he was ousted from power in 1985 . in 2003 , @entity0 -- then with the @entity113 -- lost to @entity114 in an election during which @entity117 observers reported widespread irregularities . he lost again to @entity119 in the 2007 election , which was widely condemned for rampant vote - rigging , violence , theft of ballot boxes and intimidation . after @entity119 's death in 2010 , @entity74 rose from vice president to president and @entity0 challenged him in the 2011 elections as a candidate from the @entity131 . @entity0 had helped found the party a year earlier , saying it was " a solution to the debilitating , ethical and ideological conflicts in my former party , the @entity113 . " @entity0 is a muslim from @entity2 's poorer @entity137 , while @entity74 hails from a @entity139 and animist @entity138 that is rich with oil . after @entity74 's victory in 2011 , amid accusations of vote - rigging , violent riots broke out in the @entity137 . armed protesters took to the streets chanting @entity0 's name , and more than 800 people were killed in the post-election violence . @entity0 's office issued a statement calling reports of burning of places of worship places a " sad , unfortunate and totally unwarranted development . " " i must say that this is a dastardly act ( that ) is not initiated by any of our supporters and therefore can not be supported by our party , " said @entity0 's spokesman @entity157 . " i must emphasize that this is purely a political matter , and it should not in any way be turned into an ethnic , religious or regional one . " read more : @entity2 election -- what you need to know ahead of this year 's election , @entity74 and @entity0 signed a nonviolence pact , the @entity171 , in january . on march 26 they renewed their pledge and reiterated their commitment to " free , fair and credible elections . " but violent protests broke out a day before the final results were announced . protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in @entity2 's oil - rich @entity181 as they marched to protest the elections , amid claims of vote - rigging and voter intimidation . both candidates called for calm , with @entity0 , who contested this year 's vote as part of the @entity196 , tweeting : " @entity48 , i urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced . " after the protests in @entity181 , his party demanded the elections there be canceled . but @entity2 's electoral commission decided the results would stand , saying it " did not believe the allegations were substantial enough to require the cancellation / rescheduling " of the @entity181 poll . according to his campaign website , @entity0 is from @entity207 in @entity2 's northern @entity208 and is married with eight children . his military training began in 1963 and included stints in the @entity212 , @entity213 and the @entity214 . @entity0 was the first chairman of the @entity216 , the site says . elements of @entity0 's biography were questioned in the run - up to the march 28 election . after weeks of speculation and an ongoing legal battle over allegations that @entity0 failed to complete his secondary school education , a @entity2 court on march 25 cleared the way for him to run in the presidential race after adjourning the case until april 22 . as a @entity229 from the @entity137 , @entity0 appears to have moved to address any concerns his appointment could be detrimental to @entity232 @entity48 -- approximately half the country 's population , according to the @entity235 . a blog post on his campaign website headed " @entity0 will never islamise @entity2 " describes a campaign ceremony in january in @entity238 . imo gov. @entity241 , it says , " dismissed suggestions of plans by @entity0 to ' islamize ' @entity2 , " telling the audience @entity0 's long - time cook and driver were @entity246 and his youngest daughter had married a @entity246 . @entity0 has also not been immune to the violence plaguing northern @entity2 . last year , he was targeted in a suicide bombing that killed at least 15 people in the city of @entity252 . an earlier blast in the city the same day had been aimed at a @entity229 cleric . a day after winning the country 's presidency , @entity0 told @entity1 's @entity72 that fighting corruption and curbing violence were at the top of his agenda . the economy is another major issue the new leader has to contend with , as the country overtook @entity266 last year as the continent 's largest economy . but as many as 70 % of @entity48 live below the poverty line , surviving on less than a dollar a day .
