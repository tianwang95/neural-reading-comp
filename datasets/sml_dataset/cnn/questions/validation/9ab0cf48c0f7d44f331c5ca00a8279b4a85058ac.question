( @entity2 ) this week , @entity1 cfo @entity0 made headlines when his resignation memo announcing his retirement surfaced in the media . but the uproar was n't that @entity0 was quitting so much as why . " after nearly seven years as @entity0 , " he began , " i will be retiring from @entity1 to spend more time with my family . " what he wanted now was to enjoy life at home and abroad with his wife , to " grab our backpacks and hit the road -- celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine midlife crisis full of bliss and beauty . " the letter , which he said he wrote in part because , " so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life , " has been held up as a manifesto for the " work / life balance " ideal that 's become something of the new @entity32 dream . the media has described it as " powerful " and " unusually reflective . " @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity35 said , " well worth reading , it will warm your heart . " but if @entity0 's work / life balance was achieved by quitting his job to go see the world , what message does it send to the rest of us seeking work / life balance ? what message does it send to those workers -- and in particular women -- who are constantly told they can " have it all , " or who can be at the top of their field and have a family ? what does it say to all those women to whom we say that , with a little " leaning in " or " playing big " they do n't have to choose between work and life ? successful women from @entity65 to @entity67 ceo @entity66 have spoken out about the pressure to " have it all , " and how , perhaps , there 's really no such thing . research backs them up . a november 2014 study published in the @entity73 found that women show more signs of depression as they move up the career ladder . similarly , a survey of @entity79 grads found that the pressure women put on themselves to balance work and family is causing them significant stress . the survey also found that the majority of men expected their partners to take primary responsibility for childcare -- and indeed that happened in more than 70 % of cases . and yet in recent years , " work / life balance " has been held up as a legitimately attainable ideal , one that you can achieve if only you give your personal life as much attention as your professional one . but if you look at those we tend to hold up as models of that ideal -- those who leave work earlier , silence their cellphones more , retire , as in the case of @entity0 , at 52 -- are they really striking a balance ? which is why talking about work / life balance at all is a perilous business , an invitation to fail . having it all is very difficult , if not downright impossible . @entity0 , after all , did not practice work / life balance . he wrote , " i was always on -- even when i was not supposed to be . " like many successful men ( and women ) , he was likely able to work as hard as he did while still having a family because he had the support of someone at home . " when our kids are asked by their friends about the success of the longevity of our marriage , they simply joke that @entity127 and i have spent so little time together that ' it 's really too early to tell ' if our marriage will in fact succeed . " it 's in jest , of course , and yet likely rooted in some serious reality . this is a man who did n't achieve work / life balance as an executive . of course , one could argue that the idea of balancing work with life may be harder for men than for women , who are the traditional breadwinners and the ones more likely to find self - worth through their work . this is one reason we see many wealthy , powerful men working well into their 80s . at the same time , it 's undeniably easier for these men to make a decision to leave the whole thing early . @entity0 retires as @entity1 's highest paid executive , with millions in stock incentives . he can afford to retire and not even have to work for the remainder of his life . the rest of us are nowhere close to having that luxury of choice . @entity170 , it should be noted , shoulders much of the blame for keeping balance at arm 's length , with increasingly long days and ever - tightening limits on vacations , paid leave and other " benefits . " we should n't have to leave our jobs to achieve balance , and the fact that some do , means that companies need to make real changes . that includes staffing workplaces reasonably , putting workers ' well - being on par with profits , showing workers you do n't expect them to be " on " all the time . only then will real work / life balance start to take shape . until then : " @entity1 cfo @entity0 's @entity188 will make you dream of quitting your job , " so reads a headline at @entity193 . indeed , that 's the kicker . @entity0 can " carpe diem " and " find balance , " if that 's what he 's doing , at 52 , because he truly does have choices . but for most of the workers in @entity32 , finding that sort of balance -- or choosing life over work -- will remain an impossible dream .
