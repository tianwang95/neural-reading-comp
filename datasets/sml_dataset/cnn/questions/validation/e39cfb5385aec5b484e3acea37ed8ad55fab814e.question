( @entity4 ) in an audio message purportedly from an @entity3 spokesman , the group announced that a pledge of allegiance from @entity8 - based @entity7 has been accepted by @entity3 leader @entity9 . the 28 - minute message , which can not be independently authenticated by @entity4 , was posted online by @entity3 supporters . the message says that the caliphate , or @entity13 , has expanded to western @entity14 and congratulated " our jihadi brothers " there . the spokesman , @entity17 , encourages people to join fighters in @entity14 if they can not make it to @entity21 or @entity22 . @entity7 's leader , @entity23 , announced in an audio message last week that the @entity26 terror group was going to ally with @entity3 . @entity27 , a terror expert who lives in @entity8 , told @entity4 on saturday the alliance would make sense for both groups . " @entity7 will get legitimacy , which will help its recruiting , funding and logistics as it expands , " @entity27 said . " it will also get guidance from @entity3 in media warfare and propaganda . previously @entity7 was a sort of outcast in the global @entity41 community . now it is perhaps @entity3 's biggest affiliate . " @entity3 gets more international legitimacy as a global caliphate . " @entity7 , whose name translates as " @entity55 education is sin , " has been waging a yearslong campaign of terror aimed at instituting its extreme version of @entity53 law . @entity7 's tactics have intensified in recent years , from battling @entity8 government soldiers to acts disproportionately affecting civilians -- such as raids on villages , mass kidnappings , assassinations , market bombings and attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques . much of this violence has taken place in @entity8 . but neighboring countries , such as @entity72 and @entity73 , have also been hit increasingly hard . what @entity7 's pledge of allegiance to @entity3 means @entity4 's @entity77 contributed to this report .
