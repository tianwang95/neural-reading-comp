@entity5 , @entity6 ( @entity7 ) thirty years or so ago , the synagogue in @entity1 where i was attending @entity4 services received a bomb threat . as we evacuated the building , i was concerned that people did n't seem to be taking it seriously . i was visiting from @entity13 , where terrorism was a fact of life , and i was scared . throughout the 1970s and 1980s in @entity13 , and even beyond , far - left and far - right extremists , the @entity18 , radical @entity19 , and a variety of other groups carried out thousands of terror attacks , big and small , that left thousands dead or injured . @entity26 , @entity24 -- and @entity25 -- sites were targets of some of the most notorious attacks : from the massacre of @entity24 athletes at the @entity32 , to plane and cruise ship hijackings , to attacks on airports , synagogues , and simply places where @entity26 congregated , such as the @entity40 kosher deli in @entity41 , where six died and 22 were wounded in a bloody attack in august 1982 . in @entity43 , where i lived for parts of the 1970s and ' 80s , we tended to avoid certain streets where @entity47 and @entity25 airlines had their offices . the first big story i helped cover as a young reporter was a bloody attack at the city 's @entity52 in december 1973 . a dozen years later , the daughter of friends was killed in another @entity19 attack there . the main synagogue in @entity43 has been under tight guard since @entity19 attackers threw hand grenades and sprayed machinegun fire at worshippers after services in october 1982 , killing a toddler and wounding dozens . i do n't want to discount the gravity and horror of recent terror attacks against @entity26 targets in @entity13 , such as in @entity70 and @entity41 . i just want to add some perspective . many things have changed over the decades . @entity74 power vacuums and @entity76 upheavals have given rise to radical @entity78 and globalized @entity84 terror networks whose message , fanned out via the internet and social media , strikes a chord in disaffected youth . to be sure , @entity26 are being targeted . but it is important to recognize that @entity26 are being targeted as part of a violent campaign against western democracies and western values in general . today 's victims of @entity78 terror include @entity95 and @entity96 as well as @entity26 . in the @entity76 and @entity102 , women , children , students , and cultural heritage -- history -- are also directly targeted . in some ways , today 's @entity84 terrorists can be seen as harnessing various types of terrorism we saw in earlier decades : the anti-jewish / anti-israel terrorism of radical @entity19 groups and the anti-establishment , even anarchistic terrorism of homegrown groups whose aim was to sow fear and destabilize society as a means to bring down the system . anti-semitism takes many forms . criticism of @entity24 is legitimate ( and sometimes necessary ) , but it can , and sometimes does , cross the line . this is n't new either , however . jews in @entity13 have been regarded -- and scapegoated -- as surrogates for @entity24 for decades . in 1967 - 68 , after @entity24 defeated @entity129 states in the @entity130 , @entity127 's communist regime staged an " anti-zionist " campaign that forced most of the remaining @entity26 out of the country . at least 13,000 @entity26 emigrated , according to @entity134 , who is now the director of the @entity135 . other experts put the figure as high as 20,000 . this was -- and remains -- by far the most widespread episode of @entity140 in @entity13 . twenty years later , in 1988 , a report by the @entity142 warned that a significant number of anti-semitic incidents in the @entity25 now reflected " a politically - related anti-israel component . " a @entity147 news report at the time quoted @entity142 national director @entity149 as noting that the phenomenon was new in the @entity25 , but " it 's been a common occurrence in @entity154 countries . " particularly worrisome , the report said , were @entity24 - related anti-semitic incidents on college campuses . sound familiar ? after the holocaust , it was common to view @entity26 in @entity13 as sitting with their suitcases packed , just in case . but -- unlike @entity127 's " anti-zionist " campaign -- terrorism did not prove an existential threat to @entity26 and did not prompt a mass exodus . nor should -- or will -- it now . the @entity167 , followed by @entity169 rule in half of the continent , almost succeeded in making @entity172 . following the most recent terror attacks , @entity26 and @entity154 national leaders have made clear that this is not an option . moreover , despite the terrorist threat , @entity154 governments have refused to budge in their defense of democratic values . it is wise to be on guard , of course , and there is indeed ample cause for alarm -- even fear . but we should also be on guard against something else -- against a facile temptation to cry wolf that can all too easily distort alarm into alarmism -- and fear into fear - mongering .

she says terrorism in the 1970s and ' 80s did not prove an existential threat to @placeholder or prompt a mass exodus , and nor should it now .
