@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) joint @entity1 forces now have control of @entity5 as they continue their offensive to liberate the city from @entity8 . the joint forces raised the @entity1 flag from the hospital premises wednesday as they continued their offensive into the city from four sides , the @entity10 paramilitary force said . the predominantly @entity16 militia has been working with @entity1 troops as well as @entity19 fighters to try to regain @entity20 from @entity8 . the hospital is a few blocks south of the presidential palace . @entity20 , best known to @entity24 as the birthplace of former @entity1 dictator @entity26 , fell in june to @entity8 , which has captured large areas of @entity1 and @entity28 for what it says is its @entity32 caliphate . on march 1 , @entity1 prime minister @entity33 ordered @entity1 forces to retake @entity20 and @entity35 . @entity8 was n't making it easy , however . the @entity19 extremist group blew up a key bridge near @entity20 , preventing the joint @entity1 forces from using it to cross the @entity40 to approach the city from the east . nevertheless , forces have made progress , forcing @entity8 fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions , @entity44 's media office said . there have been several failed attempts to recapture @entity20 since the second half of 2014 . if @entity1 regains control of the city , it could mean that retaking @entity56 -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible . the @entity20 offensive involves around 30,000 fighters . also assisting is @entity60 , which has provided advisers , weapons and ammunition to the @entity1 government . according to the @entity65 , @entity60 may be operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well . gen. @entity68 , chairman of the @entity69 , told a hearing of the @entity71 on wednesday that the consensus was that @entity60 's involvement was positive in military terms . " anything anyone does to counter @entity8 is in the main a good outcome , " he said . but at the same time , @entity68 said , the @entity78 is concerned about what role @entity60 might seek in the longer term once @entity8 is defeated . while @entity1 forces piled the pressure on @entity8 in @entity20 , the @entity19 extremist group continued to flex its muscles in @entity1 's western @entity86 province . @entity8 launched a new offensive on the city of @entity89 , west of @entity0 , on wednesday morning , @entity90 , the deputy head of the @entity91 , said in a statement . the city is being attacked " from all directions , " with @entity8 firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it , he said . some 17 explosives - laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center , he said . one vehicle targeted a bridge that provides access to the city from the north . this is " the fiercest attack by @entity8 " seen on @entity89 , @entity90 said . @entity1 forces have imposed a curfew on the city . @entity109 said the @entity1 air force was urgently needed . " we need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the @entity1 air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target , " he said . officials believe " this is an @entity8 response to the @entity20 operation that is ongoing in the north , " he added . he said there had been 10 casualties among @entity1 forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured . in the 24 hours from tuesday to wednesday morning , there were 13 airstrikes in @entity1 and two in @entity28 , the @entity78 - led coalition against @entity8 said in a statement . the strikes in @entity1 were concentrated near @entity56 , @entity131 and @entity132 . there were none in the @entity20 or @entity89 areas . elsewhere in @entity86 province , @entity1 security forces have managed to wrest back most of the town of @entity139 from @entity8 , said @entity140 , the head of the @entity91 . @entity140 , speaking to @entity2 by telephone , said 80 % of @entity139 , about 10 miles ( 16 kilometers ) northeast of @entity132 , was now under the control of @entity1 security forces after a large - scale operation that started tuesday at dawn . dozens of @entity8 militants were killed in clashes with @entity1 soldiers , he said . the second phase of the operation is to clear any remnants of the @entity8 force from the town and to remove any mines and bombs left behind . @entity1 security forces were fighting side by side with @entity159 units and local tribesmen , @entity140 said . health officials in @entity132 told @entity2 that the @entity132 general hospital received the bodies of 25 @entity8 militants killed in the @entity139 battle . @entity8 is also battling in many places far from @entity20 , including @entity28 , where the militant group is more on the offensive , according to the @entity169 ( @entity169 ) , a @entity170 - based nongovernmental organization . " hundreds of @entity8 militants launched a large scale offensive on @entity173 , a @entity28 strategic border town with @entity175 on friday , " @entity169 said in a statement wednesday . " they made some advances there and seized @entity178 . " clashes are still ongoing between the @entity180 ( @entity180 ypg ) and @entity8 fighters , with dozens killed from both sides , @entity169 said . @entity2 's @entity185 reported from @entity0 , and @entity186 wrote in @entity170 . @entity2 's @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 contributed to this report .
