( @entity1 ) scientists at @entity2 are one step closer to understanding how much water could have existed on primeval @entity5 . these new findings also indicate how primitive water reservoirs there could have evolved over billions of years , indicating that early oceans on the @entity5 might have held more water than @entity13 's @entity12 , @entity2 scientists reveal in a study published friday in the journal @entity16 . " our study provides a solid estimate of how much water @entity5 once had , by determining how much water was lost to space , " said @entity17 , a scientist at @entity2 's @entity18 . " with this work , we can better understand the history of water on @entity5 . " to find answers to this age - old question about @entity5 water molecules , scientists used the world 's three major infrared telescopes , in @entity33 and @entity34 , to measure traces of water in the planet 's atmosphere over a range of areas and seasons , spanning from march 2008 to january 2014 . " from the ground , we could take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere on a single night , " said @entity43 's @entity42 . scientists looked at the ratio of two different forms -- or isotopes -- of water , @entity52 and @entity53 . the latter is made heavier by one of its hydrogen atoms , called deuterium , which has a neutron at its core in addition to the proton that all hydrogen atoms have . that weighed down @entity53 more , while larger amounts of hydrogen from @entity52 floated into the atmosphere , broke away from @entity5 ' low gravity and disappeared into space . as a result , water trapped in @entity5 ' polar ice caps has a much higher level of @entity53 than fluid water on @entity13 does , the scientists said . the scientists compared the ratio of @entity52 to @entity53 in @entity5 ' atmosphere today to the ratio of the two molecules trapped inside a @entity5 meteorite , a stone that broke off from @entity5 -- perhaps when an asteroid hit -- and landed on @entity13 some 4.5 billion years ago . they were able to determine how much that ratio had changed over time and estimate how much water has disappeared from @entity5 -- about 87 % . the findings indicate that the @entity5 could have had its fair share of blue waters , possibly even yielding an ocean . according to @entity2 , there might have been enough water to cover up to 20 % of @entity5 ' surface . that would amount to an ocean proportionally larger than the @entity96 on @entity13 . " this ocean had a maximum depth of around 5,000 feet or around one mile deep , " said @entity17 . @entity2 scientists say that much of this water loss happened over billions of years , along with a loss of atmosphere . and as the planet 's atmospheric pressure dropped , it was harder for water to stay in liquid form . @entity107 also contributed to its evaporation . as a result , the remaining primeval ocean water continued to move toward the poles , where it eventually froze . " with @entity5 losing that much water , the planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought , suggesting it might have been habitable for longer , " said @entity42 . @entity1 's @entity118 contributed to this report .
