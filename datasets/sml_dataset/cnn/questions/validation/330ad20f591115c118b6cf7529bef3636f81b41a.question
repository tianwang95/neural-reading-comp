( @entity1 ) @entity0 was n't moving when rescuers found her , hanging upside down in her mother 's smashed car . it had flipped over into a frigid @entity7 river half a day before , and the baby was still strapped in her seat . as officer @entity10 dashed with the 18 - month - old in his arms to an ambulance , she was barely alive . but she 's doing better , her family said monday . " her improvement is astounding . right now she 's watching ' @entity15 ) ' and singing ' ( the ) @entity16 ' with @entity17 . she is smiling and laughing for family members . we 're blown away by @entity0 's progress and so grateful to her rescuers , " they said . @entity0 's mother , @entity22 , died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the @entity27 . she was 25 years old . @entity0 might have died unseen with her mother , had a man not gone fishing in that particular spot saturday . the angler waded into the river around noon , then noticed the car wheels - up in the water . " where the car was , you could n't see it from the roadway , " police lt. @entity35 said . the fisherman called emergency dispatch . police and fire rescuers arrived and sprang into the water . the rest of what happened is now a frenetic blur for officer @entity49 . " i do n't remember doing anything but just doing it , " he said . the water was so cold that , when the rescue was over , seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia . they heaved the car onto its side and saw @entity22 in the driver 's seat . it was clear to them that she was dead . then they noticed the baby . " she was definitely unconscious and not responsive , " @entity10 said . but she was still alive , and rescuers were delighted to see it . she was still strapped into her seat , where she may have been for 14 hours , if the wreck occurred when police believe it did . the night before , a man living nearby heard a loud crash and stepped outside to check , but he saw nothing unusual , police said , and dismissed it . that was at about 10:30 p.m. on friday . @entity22 's car had probably just struck a bridge embankment . " the driver 's side tire went up the cement barrier on the south end of the bridge , launching this woman and her baby into the freezing water , " @entity35 told @entity1 affiliate @entity79 . the angler came along around 12:30 p.m. on saturday , 14 hours later . @entity22 's death is tragic , but the survival of baby @entity0 is a story filled with hope . but just how did the baby survive the ordeal ? above all , said @entity1 senior medical correspondent @entity95 , the biggest factor was the car seat . @entity0 was in the proper car seat and the seat appears to have been properly attached , @entity95 said . even though the child was trapped and upside down , her body remained in the seat and above the frigid water . doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous , but would be even more so if the baby were wet . dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures , @entity95 said . another factor may have been that the girl , as a toddler , has baby fat . if she had been an infant , it might have been a different story , @entity95 said . it 's a reminder that the human body is tough . @entity0 apparently survived for 14 hours in extreme cold , without food or drink . a mystery arose from the rescue : the police officers who entered the water say they heard a voice calling for help . the mother was dead , but the officers said that they heard an adult 's voice calling to them . " the four of us heard a distinct voice coming from the car , " @entity10 told @entity1 . " to me , it did n't sound like a child 's voice . " the voice gave the rescuers a surge of adrenaline needed to push the vehicle upright , he said . the mother was dead . the child was unconscious , but her eyelids were fluttering , and the rescuers knew she was alive , @entity10 said . it 's one of those things that does n't have an explanation , he said about the voice . " it felt like i could hear someone telling me , ' i need help , ' " @entity49 told @entity1 affiliate @entity150 . " it was very surreal , something that i felt like i could hear . " @entity155 , a third officer at the scene , said the same . " all i know is that it was there , we all heard it , and that just helped us to push us harder , like i say , and do what we could to rescue anyone inside the car , " he told @entity1 's " @entity165 360 . " the river is 10 feet deep in some places , police said , but the car hit a shallower spot . images showed it only partly covered by water . @entity0 was not submerged , said police lt. @entity173 . firefighter @entity175 freed her from the wreck . he " grabbed the baby in my arm , raised its head up out of water , as i tried to release the seat belt , " he said . then @entity10 took @entity0 into his arms . " the child was passed to me and i ran up and climbed into the ambulance with the child , " he said . police have no explanation for the wreck . no alcohol or drugs were in play , they told @entity79 . there were no skid marks leading up to the impact . a tow truck hauled @entity22 's car out of the river , and it will be inspected for possible mechanical failures . @entity22 's family has set up a gofundme page for donations to help with medical expenses for @entity0 , and funeral costs for her mother . late monday , it had reached more than $ 35,500 , surpassing its goal of $ 8,000 . @entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity95 , @entity212 @entity211 and @entity213 contributed to this report .
