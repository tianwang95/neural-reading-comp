( @entity4 ) the @entity1 nuclear negotiations in @entity2 , @entity3 , reportedly have made substantive progress , inching closer toward a provisional agreement between the @entity7 and @entity1 . while the talks continued to unfold this week , @entity9 prime minister @entity8 restated his concern about an agreement with @entity1 , vowing " to continue to act against any threat . " if an agreement is reached , the international spotlight will turn to @entity9 , in anticipation of its possible reaction . @entity9 defense minister @entity18 stated that a deal is " a tragedy for the whole world . " the question is , however , what can @entity9 really do once a deal is signed ? in recent days , notable conservatives in the @entity26 have attacked president @entity28 's handling of the negotiations with @entity1 , arguing that a bad deal will force @entity9 's hand , leaving it with no choice but to attack @entity1 targets . but is this a realistic conclusion ? @entity9 's stated " all options are on the table " policy toward @entity1 has been in place for years and is based on the assumption that if a diplomatic solution to the nuclear problem can not be reached or is not to its liking , @entity9 can decide to opt for a military strike on @entity1 's nuclear facilities . thirty - four years after the successful @entity9 bombing of the @entity48 nuclear facility in @entity49 , military experts have little doubt that the @entity9 @entity51 today is capable of reaching @entity1 airspace and bombing targets above and below ground . therefore , the question is not one of military capability but more about domestic political and geopolitical strategy . with an @entity1 deal in place , the @entity9 leadership may face stern objections from the heads of the @entity9 defense establishment , which will make it difficult but not impossible to take such a decision . nevertheless , if it remains keen on pursuing a military option , the @entity9 leadership will have to consider the following set of consequences that will likely result from such a decision : a successful military strike on @entity1 installations may degrade @entity1 's nuclear program , setting it back several years , but it would not completely eliminate @entity1 's nuclear capabilities . @entity1 would likely be able to resume activity in new facilities soon after such an attack , with more international legitimacy to embark on a military nuclear program , in the face of future military challenges to its sovereignty and stability . a deal between the @entity7 ( the @entity26 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 ) and @entity1 is expected to include a 10 - year ( or more ) " sunset provision " that is much longer than the period it will take @entity1 to get its program back on track in case of an @entity9 attack . a military attack against @entity1 after a deal is signed would put @entity9 on a collision course with the @entity7 + 1 , who were negotiating the contours of a deal with @entity1 , as well as with other members of the international community . bilateral ties and cooperation with member states of the @entity7 may suffer , as well as intelligence sharing between the relevant intelligence agencies . in addition , countries are likely to seek ways to " punish " @entity9 for its actions , in the form of a @entity117 or @entity118 resolution condemning @entity9 behavior , calling for operative measures against the jewish state . an @entity9 attack would likely lead to the collapse of the international sanctions regime on @entity1 , which @entity9 has worked to consolidate and which has been a very effective mechanism in pressuring @entity1 . the understanding between @entity9 and moderate @entity128 regimes on the need to prevent a nuclear @entity1 would not be likely to dissipate in the aftermath of an attack , but @entity9 - @entity128 coordination and cooperation on this issue is bound to suffer . finally , an @entity9 attack would spark a direct @entity1 military reaction against @entity9 , as well as an indirect reaction against @entity9 in the region by @entity1 's proxies @entity140 ( from @entity141 and war - torn @entity142 ) and @entity144 ( from @entity145 and perhaps the @entity146 ) and against @entity9 targets abroad . in the aftermath of a deal with @entity1 , @entity9 's response is expected to be harsh . it will include strong public criticism of the deal , a vow to continue the fight against the agreement in the @entity156 and other relevant venues , a call for the international community to continue the sanctions regime , and a pursuit of coordinated public messaging with moderate @entity128 regimes on this issue . these @entity9 public diplomacy measures will be complemented by continued intelligence monitoring of @entity1 's activities in the nuclear sphere as well as its involvement in regional conflicts . opting for a military strike against @entity1 , however , must take into consideration the consequences of such a decision . in light of all that is at stake , it does not seem like a plausible option at present .
