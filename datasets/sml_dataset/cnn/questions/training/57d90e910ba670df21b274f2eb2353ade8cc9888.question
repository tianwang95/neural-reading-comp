( @entity0 ) -- the failure of the @entity2 ( the @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 plus @entity8 ) to reach agreement with @entity10 saturday in @entity11 is a good thing if it allows the @entity3 and @entity13 to sort out what really divides them on the @entity10 nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days . that the @entity5 -- not the @entity3 -- seem to have taken the lead in stiffening the allies ' demands with @entity10 is in itself a reflection of those differences . and while a high - ranking @entity3 delegation headed to @entity13 sunday to brief the @entity13 on the talks , bridging the gap there wo n't be that easy . where you stand in life has a great deal to do with where you sit . prime minister @entity34 's fierce reaction to the effort to reach an interim agreement reflects the realities of a small power with much less room to maneuver on a critical security issue than a great one . and it reveals the sensitivities of an @entity13 leader who 's far more invested politically in seeing a nuke - free @entity10 , far more suspicious of @entity10 motives and far more worried about the consequences of a bad deal for @entity13 than a @entity3 president who 's concerned more about what happens if there 's no deal and @entity13 or the @entity3 slides toward military confrontation with the mullahs who rule @entity10 . that gap between the @entity3 and @entity13 is real . and it should neither be trivialized nor exaggerated . but short of a final deal in which @entity10 abandons its nuclear ambitions , it may not be bridgeable . these two allies will need to manage it as best they can . and here 's why . @entity64 and @entity65 with non-predatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west , the @entity3 enjoys a level of physical security unprecedented in the history of great and small powers . that gives @entity3 a margin for error that the small power simply can not afford . indeed , @entity3 have a hard time internalizing what it 's like to be a small nation living on the knife 's edge , whose tiny physical size , isolation and sense of vulnerability exists alongside its power and strength . i do n't think @entity10 wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against @entity13 . but it 's impossible to ignore , let alone trivialize , @entity13 security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard , particularly in the face of @entity10 's rhetoric , regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years . @entity13 is n't some hapless victim , a piece of driftwood bobbing about on a turbulent sea ; it 's a dynamic nation ( and a nuclear weapons state ) with great military power with the capacity if need be to deal with @entity10 too . but that does n't take away from the reality that it 's a small country living in a dangerous neighborhood . @entity34 's @entity113 all @entity13 prime ministers are said to sleep with one eye open . @entity34 sleeps with two eyes open . no @entity13 prime minister can afford to take @entity13 's security for granted . and none does . but ever since i 've known him , the key to understanding this prime minister is that he 's immersed in the proposition that @entity13 's very survival ca n't be taken for granted either . all @entity13 leaders function in a high threat environment . but in @entity34 's case , it defines his world and creates an us - against - them sensibility that extends to @entity13 's adversaries and its friends too . he has been deeply suspicious of @entity3 motives for many years and believes the @entity3 does n't understand the @entity135 or @entity13 's security predicament . you live in @entity138 , he 's said to me on more than one occasion ; we live in a dangerous neighborhood with little margin for error . i never argued with him . what was the point ? unlike @entity13 , there is no existential threat to the @entity3 from any external enemy largely because of where we are . but @entity13 's history has been marked by a continuous series of threats -- large and small -- by virtue of where the @entity13 are . however powerful they have become , that legacy endures . and combined with the dark history of the @entity162 people culminating in the @entity8 genocide , it has left an enduring mark . the notion that @entity13 fight the @entity135 during the day and win and fight the @entity166 at night and lose carries particular resonance with this @entity13 prime minister . the late @entity13 prime minister @entity169 never used @entity171 imagery to describe the contemporary threats to @entity13 's security . @entity174 refused to use @entity176 analogies when discussing @entity10 . @entity34 does , repeatedly . @entity10 is @entity8 ; former @entity10 president @entity177 is @entity176 and we 're in 1938 on the nuclear issue . it infuses his rhetoric and his world view . and while @entity183 has changed the tone and may be genuinely looking for an agreement , the charm offensive has n't dulled the acuteness of @entity34 's suspicions . consequences of @entity13 - @entity3 tensions this world view poses enormous challenges for a @entity3 administration , partly because it 's validated by @entity10 's own past rhetoric and actions and because @entity10 has tried to hide suspected military aspects of its nuclear program . leaving an angry , aggrieved @entity13 in the wake of an interim deal with @entity10 that is judged to be a bad deal carries tremendous risk and consequence . first , the focus is now on an interim agreement -- a first step . that means that we wo n't know the end state for at least six months . time is both an enemy and an ally here . the step - by - step approach creates time to test intentions . it also affords time for @entity10 to continue to advance aspects of its nuclear program and to develop a break - out capacity to dash for weapons . and they are going to be a rocky six months if @entity34 concludes that the interim arrangements reached in @entity11 work to @entity10 's advantage . going right to the endgame would be ideal . but it 's just not feasible . there 's too much suspicion and mistrust . and neither @entity10 nor the @entity3 are prepared for that . so there 's built in @entity3 - @entity13 tension inherent in the structure of the talks themselves . second , while the prime minister 's fierce reaction to events in @entity11 is driven by genuine anger and concern , it 's also designed to begin to stir up opposition in @entity239 . and it wo n't take much stirring . there 's zero capacity in @entity239 to give @entity10 the benefit of the doubt on anything . and @entity239 is already inclined to adopt the @entity13 view that what 's required now is more pressure on the mullahs rather than less , including additional sanctions . the idea that the @entity253 administration would want to place itself in a position of defending a deal with @entity10 that @entity13 and much of @entity239 oppose -- and appear implicitly to be defending the @entity10 in the process -- defies the laws of political gravity , particularly for a much weakened president . to overcome these political downsides and go into battle mode , the administration would really have to have a compelling interim agreement that 's sound and defensible . third , the @entity3 is measuring an agreement with @entity10 at this stage not against an ideal end state -- @entity10 capitulates and surrenders any hope of maintaining the capacity to enrich uranium , let alone make bombs . it 's evaluating success in terms of what 's practical and what will happen if no deal is reached , namely the slide toward the use of military force against @entity10 . @entity13 do n't want a war with @entity10 either ; but they are much more comfortable with threatening military action and conditioned to accept the possibility that force may have to be used , even if the end state is an imperfect one and @entity10 sets about rebuilding a nuclear program . the key issue is putting time on the clock to delay @entity10 getting nukes -- preferably through diplomacy , but if necessary by force . fourth , an already problematic @entity13 - @entity291 peace process is going to get a lot more complicated . narrowing the gaps on borders , refugees and @entity296 was always going to be tough ; but now getting @entity34 to make decisions will be almost impossible . @entity13 - @entity291 peace process at risk whether the administration thought through the overlapping of a peace process with a nine - month timeline and a negotiation with @entity10 of six months now aligned to come to fruition right around the same time is n't clear . but the coincidence of the timing could n't be worse . the odds that this prime minister would make decisions on historic issues with the @entity291 before there was clarity on @entity10 's nuclear program were always slim to none . for @entity34 , the @entity291 are a long - term challenge ; @entity10 is an imminent , acute problem . and a @entity34 who believes the @entity3 are n't taking him seriously on @entity10 is certain to be withholding when it comes to the peace process . to satisfy @entity13 requirements , an interim agreement would have to do at least three things : first , avoid doing anything that dismantles the sanctions regime and removes real pressure on @entity10 to cut the final deal ; second , make it impossible for @entity10 to use the next six months to advance in a significant way any of the aspects of its nuclear program -- not just to freeze @entity10 's program but to actually set it back significantly . and finally , not to do anything with regard to sanctions that ca n't be reversed . all of this may not be possible . but in the next 10 days before negotiations with @entity10 resume , everything should be done to try to make certain that @entity339 and @entity296 understand one another and to ensure that there 's as much confidence and trust going forward as possible . an orchestrated good cop / bad cop routine between allies could be helpful in negotiating with @entity10 . a rift that signals the @entity3 and @entity13 are fundamentally out of step is not . there are no happy or perfect endings here . at best , the choice is between an imperfect interim agreement that buys six months to determine whether @entity10 is prepared to give up its quest for a nuclear weapons capacity or no agreement and an inevitable slide toward military confrontation . as of now the @entity3 sees the advantage of the former ; @entity34 does n't . the @entity3 has no stake in concluding an agreement with @entity10 that leaves @entity13 angry , aggrieved and vulnerable . so , the two sides will find a way to work this through . but for now , buckle your seat belts . we could be in for one bumpy ride . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity370 .

@entity375 says a key problem is gap between @placeholder and @entity13 on @entity10
