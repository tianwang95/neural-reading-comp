@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity2 is the last of a dying breed : an old - fashioned press baron with ink running through his veins , a hefty checkbook , and a hunger for the next big story . now aged 83 , he has spent the past half century turning a business that began with one local @entity14 newspaper into a massive multimedia empire which spans the globe and includes tv , online , film and print interests . the phone - hacking scandal forced him to close the @entity22 tabloid that was his pride and joy , @entity21 , and for a time even appeared to jeopardize his global empire , valued by @entity26 at $ 9.4 billion . it led the powerful businessman to submit himself for questioning by @entity22 politicians , where he declared : " this is the most humble day of my life . " but @entity2 bounced back from the crisis , and he remains at the helm of his global empire . in 2013 , @entity36 , the @entity22 subsidiary of @entity2 's @entity37 was rebranded @entity36 , while @entity37 itself split into two separate entities . @entity37 is now focused on publishing while @entity41 encompasses television and film assets . this month , @entity26 estimated the net worth of @entity2 and his family at $ 14.5 billion , adding that stocks from the two companies had boosted his worth by more than $ 2 billion in the past year . the same year , @entity2 filed for divorce from his third wife , @entity50 . @entity51 had grabbed headlines when she lunged to defend her husband from a pie - throwing intruder at a 2011 parliamentary hearing in @entity0 , earning her the sobriquet " tiger wife . " but speculation about the state of the couple 's relationship had swirled for months before @entity2 's spokesman confirmed the divorce . one tweet fittingly declared that @entity2 had gone " from tabloid boss to tabloid prey . " the media mogul was kept on the edge of the limelight from october 2013 , when former employees went on trial for alleged phone hacking . the newspaper business is in @entity2 's blood . born in @entity76 , @entity14 , in 1931 , he was one of four children -- the only son -- of a celebrated journalist and his debutante - turned - philanthropist wife . his father , @entity80 , was a reporter who exposed the horrific conditions experienced by @entity83 troops fighting at @entity84 in @entity85 , and went on to manage a large newspaper company . " i was raised in a newspaper family by a father who believed that the newspaper was among the most important instruments of human freedom , " @entity2 declared in his 2008 @entity87 . his mother , @entity93 , was inspired to devote her life to " good works " as a schoolgirl . at the time of her death in 2012 , aged 103 , she remained a supporter of more than 100 charities , and enjoyed an almost regal status in @entity14 . @entity2 was studying at @entity102 when his father died in 1952 . mentored -- like his father -- by press baron @entity104 , he learned his trade as a reporter in @entity108 , @entity109 and as a Â £ 10 - a - week sub-editor at @entity104 's @entity111 in @entity0 before returning home to take charge of the family business . " i found myself a newspaper proprietor at the age of 22 , " @entity2 said in 2008 . " i was so young and so new to the business that when i pulled my car into the lot on my first day , the garage attendant admonished me , ' hey sonny , you ca n't park here . ' " despite his youth , the new boss of the @entity123 took to the job like a duck to water , quickly getting embroiled in a newspaper war -- the first of many -- with local rival the @entity130 . " it cost a great deal , " he said . " but it taught me that with good editors and a loyal readership , you can challenge better - heeled and more established rivals -- and succeed . " he was soon looking to expand the company : after buying up other local papers across the country , in 1964 , he set up @entity14 's first national newspaper , the @entity14 , and in 1969 , moved overseas to purchase his first @entity22 paper , @entity21 , shortly followed by @entity143 the sensationalism and sex on the pages of some of his papers provoked shock and anger among his competitors on @entity152 , and earned @entity2 a number of less than complimentary nicknames . as @entity157 , editor of @entity22 satirical magazine @entity158 , told @entity1 : " [ we have ] referred to @entity2 as the @entity160 throughout his long career , and it 's not an accident ; he does dig up dirt and then puts it in papers and sells it . " his hunger for the latest scoops -- and his willingness to pay for them -- have ensured massive sales figures , but have also caused controversy over the years , from @entity169 's kiss - and - tell over the @entity170 , to the " @entity171 " ( later revealed to be fakes ) to @entity174 's " if i did it " book . that desire to be first with the big news has led some to question his methods -- even before the phone - hacking scandal . " he ran close to what might be considered journalistic ethics , " said @entity179 , former editor - in - chief of the @entity183 , which @entity2 took over in 1976 . " i 'm not saying he broke the law , i 'm not saying he did anything illegal , but i am saying he 's aggressive in getting stories . " print unions that aggression was evident in the mid- 1980s when @entity2 , by then the owner of @entity0 's @entity191 and @entity192 papers , broke the stranglehold of the unions on the country 's print industry . after months of plotting , the media titan switched his operations from @entity152 to @entity201 , in the east end of @entity0 , and from hot metal to computerized systems overnight , forcing hundreds of printers out of work . " he was the man who tamed the print unions so that newspapers became incredibly profitable , " said @entity207 , former deputy editor of the @entity143 and @entity21 . those profits were plowed into @entity2 's growing @entity211 of tv and film interests in the @entity214 , helping to create the corporate behemoth that is @entity37 , which now also owns the influential @entity216 , @entity214 's largest circulation daily . the thrice - married father - of - six @entity2 has long been at the center of a frenzied succession debate -- something the current scandal only complicates . his oldest four children -- daughters @entity224 and @entity93 , and sons @entity226 and @entity228 -- all have a say in the running of the company . his youngest daughters @entity233 ( born 2001 ) and @entity234 ( born 2003 ) , with @entity50 , are both said to have a financial share in @entity37 famously hands - on , @entity2 has never shied away from getting stuck in -- whether tracking down a story , or dictating the political direction of his papers . " if i see things in the paper which i think are incorrect , i 'll certainly point it out and say ' so - and - so made a mistake here , ' or ' this was n't as good a report as was in the opposition newspapers , ' " he told the makers of @entity249 documentary " who 's afraid of @entity2 ? " in 1981 . " i ... have the right to insist on excellence . " on the same program , @entity253 , former managing editor of the @entity183 said @entity2 's role went beyond commenting and suggesting . " @entity2 wrote headlines , @entity2 shaped stories , @entity2 dictated the leads of stories , " he said . " @entity2 was everywhere . " in a 1968 television interview , @entity2 admitted that he enjoyed the power his position gave him , but -- in remarks that now seem more relevant than ever -- insisted : " we have more responsibility than power , i think . " a newspaper can create great controversies , stir up arguments within the community ... can throw light on injustices , just as it can do the opposite , can hide things and be a great power for evil . " but even those who may be considered his enemies recognize @entity2 's business acumen . " he 's a dealmaker , he 's a brilliant businessman , " @entity281 , of the @entity22 's @entity283 newspaper , which broke the hacking story , told @entity1 . " he 's a great strategic mind . "
