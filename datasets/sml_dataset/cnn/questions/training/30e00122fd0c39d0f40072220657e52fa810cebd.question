a first round of @entity2 peace talks did n't go too well , and now the government delegation wo n't commit to a second round . meanwhile , @entity2 president @entity6 's regime has failed to turn over its known chemical weapons stockpiles on time , causing @entity9 secretary of state @entity8 to warn on friday that all options remain available to force compliance . the dual developments showed the challenges facing efforts by the international community to halt the @entity2 civil war through talks intended to set up a transitional government , and rid @entity2 of its chemical weapons that already have been used in the conflict . president @entity21 threatened a military response last year when @entity9 authorities determined the @entity6 regime attacked its own people with chemical weapons . however , @entity21 failed to secure backing from @entity28 or key ally @entity29 . instead , @entity2 ally @entity31 stepped in to persuade @entity6 to hand over the chemical weapons stockpiles to the international community in order to be destroyed . that process started on schedule , but the @entity37 that is overseeing @entity2 's handover of its stockpiles said friday that @entity2 officials need to speed things up . " while the two shipments ( of chemicals ) this month represent a start , the need for the process to pick up pace is obvious , " director - general @entity42 said . @entity8 : fresh barrel bomb attack shows @entity2 regime 's ' true colors ' @entity8 to @entity2 : all options on the table in @entity54 , @entity8 said @entity6 " needs to understand that he agreed to an international @entity56 which has reinforced a requirement that he remove all of those weapons and that he do so in a specific period of time . " " every indication we have is there is no legitimate reason that that is not happening now , " @entity8 said , noting that an international military response remained a possibility . " and therefore , we call on @entity6 to live up to his obligations or we will join together with our friends and talk about which , if any , of the options we deem necessary at this point to proceed forward . " in @entity76 , the initial talks involving @entity6 's government and the @entity2 opposition came to a quiet close on friday , a week after they started with much fanfare . " this is a modest beginning , but it is a beginning on which we can build , " @entity56 special envoy @entity79 told reporters . he said the peace talks were scheduled to resume in @entity76 on february 10 . while the opposition has agreed to the date , the @entity2 government delegation said it must first consult with @entity87 , according to @entity79 . noting that " the gaps between the two sides remain wide ; there 's no use pretending otherwise , " he said that " nevertheless , during our discussions i observed a little bit of common ground -- perhaps more than the two sides themselves realize or recognize . " the more than two years of fighting have embittered both sides to the point that reconciliation seems unreachable , particularly involving the opposition demand -- backed by the @entity9 -- that @entity6 ca n't be part of any future transitional leadership . " we felt like we were drinking from a poisoned chalice while the criminal was killing our women , children , young men and women , and elderly , " said a statement released friday by @entity106 leader @entity105 after the close of the first round of talks . " the only consolation that we had was that the regime which had been oppressing us for more than 50 years had arrived in @entity76 to dig its own grave with its own hands . " @entity79 focuses on tiny steps forward emphasizing the positive , @entity79 said that over the past eight days , the two sides at least became used to being in the same room , and that moments occurred when one side acknowledged the concerns of the other . both sides understand that @entity2 's civil war has caused immense suffering , recognize the urgent need to bring the violence to an end and are committed to discussing the full implementation of the so - called @entity134 communique to achieve a political solution , he said . they also understand the need to rapidly address the humanitarian situation in @entity2 , wherever that need exists in the country , @entity79 added . however , he acknowledged no breakthrough so far on delivering aid to the besieged city of @entity144 . " some good news came yesterday with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the @entity148 for @entity150 refugees , " he said . " but so much more is needed . " @entity2 foreign minister @entity151 said the government was still " hopeful " and wanted to engage in dialogue , but that the differences between the two sides had been very apparent . " they are not in touch at all with what is happening on the ground in @entity2 , " he said , adding that @entity2 rejects outside interference in its affairs . opposition spokesman @entity161 said just starting the talks with the government represented progress in the fight . " we believe the only way to stop violence and to ... end the work of any group that is part of a terrorist agenda is to start the transition , " he said . a terror group too brutal for @entity175 ? a call for constructive engagement the @entity178 was critical of the @entity2 government 's delay in confirming the date for the start of the next round of talks . " the opposition has once again shown a seriousness of purpose in these negotiations by quickly committing to participate in the next round of talks , while the regime continues to play games , " said @entity185 , a @entity178 spokesman . heading to a security conference in @entity194 , @entity8 described the @entity2 conflict as a destabilizing factor in the region . the @entity198 also will be attended by @entity79 , @entity31 foreign minister @entity199 , @entity56 secretary - general @entity200 and @entity202 foreign minister @entity201 -- all major players in the @entity2 situation . the @entity206 communique of june 2012 called for a transitional government and for @entity6 to step down . the government has said that is not an option . more than 100,000 @entity2 have been killed in the conflict , which has forced more than 2 million people to become refugees . opposition groups have long called on the @entity2 government to halt its relentless attacks on rebel - controlled areas . the government argues that it is fighting terrorism backed by outside parties . the conflict has also been mired by accusations that the @entity87 government used chemical weapons and that the opposition includes @entity175 - affiliated groups .
