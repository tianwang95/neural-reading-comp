( @entity0 ) -- they 're among the rarest instruments in the world , but they 'll be discarded come spring . they 're so fragile even the players ' breath risks nudging them out of tune . turn up the temperature in the concert hall and you 'd have , not a finely chiseled viola , flute or conga , but a glass of water . " and you 'd be healthier for drinking it ! " says @entity17 , ice - instrument maker extraordinaire to an orchestra playing a series of concerts throughout the winter in the remote @entity24 town of @entity25 , just beneath the @entity26 . hearing is believing hearing really is believing when it comes to these evanescent instruments made -- bar the strings and other odd parts of metal or wood -- entirely from frozen water . @entity17 has held ice concerts not only in @entity38 over the past 15 years but also in far - flung locations from @entity40 , @entity41 , to the @entity43 alps . his main problem , he says , in attracting a greater audience to the genre is people 's incredulity that an ice instrument could make more than the most rudimentary sound . a recording of an ice violinist busking a solo classical piece outside @entity25 's @entity54 in around -10 c is evidence to the contrary . the sound is sharp and ethereal , with a wide tonal range . not only classical but the ice repertoire does n't include only refined , classical pieces . along with the violins and a viola , cellos and a bass , there 's an ice banjo in this year 's lineup to accent country and bluegrass numbers . six - and 12 - string guitars suit rock ' n ' roll , and an ice xylophone resting on bicycle inner tubes -- to aid its resonance -- works across the genres . as for the orchestra 's gigantic spherical " bubble drums , " @entity17 tells @entity0 , " they really shake your skeleton . " doubtless they 'll be deployed to funky effect in the -- inevitably , this being @entity38 -- series of @entity86 - themed concerts among the 40 or so on the program this year . winter pursuit a stone sculptor in warmer months , the bearded @entity17 , 53 , makes all the instruments for the winter concerts in a six - week burst in his back garden . they 're transported to a specially built igloo auditorium seating 170 people in a nature park outside @entity25 , where the orchestra plays . originally from @entity99 , @entity17 was invited to this town of 80,000 residents in @entity102 10 years ago to take part in the building of one of the world 's first ice hotels . he met his wife here . that 's one reason he 's stuck around , but no doubt it also helped that @entity25 is one of the coldest towns in @entity38 . saving on its air con bills , @entity114 is building its first server farm outside the @entity117 in the town . lovers of a cold climate so , apart from loving a sub-zero climate , how else do ice instruments differ from the conventional kind ? they 're quicker to make , for a start , @entity17 says . " i can do the carving on the front and back plate of a standup bass in two hours . " the chisel just glides through the ice . " my tools are similar to those of a regular instrument maker , " he says . but when it comes to sealing one of his creations together , " the only glue i use is water . " " if you want to glue a crack in an ice instrument , you just take a little straw , blow through it until the ice melts and then let it freeze again . " with wood , you can only carve . " with ice , you can also grow . " just add water ! another difference from conventional instrument making ? @entity17 wears dishwashing gloves while he 's carving , something you would n't see many master violin makers doing . icy materials the sculptor works mainly with " white ice , " a pearl - colored blend of water and snow that 's especially flexible when frozen . then there 's clear ice : " pure frozen water with no flaws , just molecule against molecule all the way through . " but it 's harder to find . @entity38 is a good place to look , but you have to dig 20 centimeters beneath a lake surface to find the bubble - free stuff . @entity179 wrought from either material are both more beautiful and more fragile than traditional instruments , @entity177 says . what other instrument , he asks , lets the light shine through ? their unique visual qualities are exploited in the performances , when non-warming leds , constantly shifting in color , are placed inside the instruments . " it 's like a nightclub in heaven , " @entity17 says . spring thaw the instruments are exceedingly delicate . they melt in springtime and require constant maintenance before then . when played , the violins are suspended by strings from the ceiling to keep them from the musician 's warm body . just the breath from players and audience means every instrument has to be re-tuned slightly between each song . such attention is worth it , says @entity17 , for the exquisite sound these magical objects produce . " ice instruments have a more detailed sound than wood , say , which absorbs the vibrations from the strings and dampens the sound , " he says . " ice is stiffer . it picks up all the vibrations . " that 's why it makes your hair stand on end . " you might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly clear -- until you hear an ice instrument and go , ' ah ha ! ' " the clarity is crystal . " flight plans up next on @entity177 's icy agenda is an instrument dreamed up specifically for ice called the orgasmatron , after the machine in the @entity238 film " @entity239 . " it 's like a cello , but one a player bows from inside , making his or her body part of the sound . @entity17 does n't intend his ice - crafting career to end with instruments . his dream project is an ultralight airplane made from ice . luckily , temperatures tends to get colder the higher you fly . @entity253 continues in @entity25 until april 6 . you can view the concert program at @entity255 . tickets booked at @entity257 . pieces of ice : " @entity260 , " played by @entity261 " @entity262 , " played by cellist @entity263 .
