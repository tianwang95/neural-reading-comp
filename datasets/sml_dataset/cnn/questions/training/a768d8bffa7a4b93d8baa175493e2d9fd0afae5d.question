four decades before anyone took an arrow to the knee in " @entity4 , " adventurers were sitting down with paper and pencil to battle fantasy monsters and explore rich , new worlds in a different kind of role - playing game . " @entity19 , " commonly known simply as @entity11 , burst onto the scene in 1974 , long before the word " gaming " came with the implied word " video " in front of it . in @entity11 , the brainchild of creators @entity23 and @entity24 , players could become fighters , magic - users , and clerics , and run through adventures created by a " @entity29 " or " @entity29 " -- the person responsible for controlling nearly every aspect of the game . players sat around a table rolling multi-sided dice and visualizing the adventure using just their imaginations -- a far cry from today 's vast , richly rendered video - game worlds . but four decades later , and with all its high - tech competition , " @entity19 " continues to grow and evolve . and many of today 's computer games , animated television shows , feature films , novels , and even pop and rock songs owe much to @entity11 lore . " in today 's culture , @entity11 has found its place as a leader and influencer over storytellers across so many different mediums , " said @entity48 , brand director for @entity11 at @entity49 , the company publishing the game . " from game designers and musicians , to scores of screenwriters and film directors , @entity11 has had a profound effect on those who have brought fantasy and geek culture to the foreground . " @entity67 worship ? indeed , many creators of fantasy games and stories today probably cut their teeth on @entity11 as kids , or teens . the game allowed players to tap into their own creativity while socializing with friends . or , for some , with their family . @entity80 , co-founder for the webcomic , " @entity82 , " said he started playing @entity11 with his young aunts and uncles , much to the chagrin of his mother . " my mom flipped out , of course . the belief that ' @entity19 ' constituted some kind of ' satanic ritual ' was a common refrain at my house , " @entity80 said . " when i got older , i hid the fact that i played it . where she might have found another young person 's pornography or drugs , she found my @entity29 's guide . honestly , i think she would have preferred the drugs . " by the early ' 80s , as the game grew in popularity with wargamers , then college and high school students , it drew the attention of some religious groups that claimed -- as they would with " @entity112 " decades later -- that the game encouraged witchcraft and demon worship . for others , @entity11 opened the door to expanding their circle of friends at a time in their formative years when shyness may have otherwise taken over . video game creator @entity118 did n't have friends to play @entity11 with when he discovered the game in 1978 . but a trip to summer camp and a chance meeting with others who played introduced him to many new people . " so i went from having no friends and no social circle to an immediate social circle through ' @entity19 , ' " said @entity118 , who is best known as creator of the " @entity130 " series . " we were playing a module out of the ' @entity136 called ' @entity137 of mad professor @entity138 . ' @entity140 that night is still my best friend to this day . " " without @entity19 , there is a very different person in this chair right now . i just do n't know if i would have made the connection -- the social network with the people i met . " by 1981 , the game had more than 3 million players worldwide . by 2007 , that number grew to 6 million , and the numbers keep rising . influence on video games universally considered the first modern role - playing game , @entity11 set the benchmark for many future rpg games -- either the table - top or computer variety . beyond simple game mechanics , the game allowed players to understand how to tell a story or craft an adventure that kept people engaged and entertained . " often times when people think of @entity11 , they think of the dice , maps and groups of friends sitting around the kitchen table , " @entity48 said . " but @entity11 has also been in the video game space as far back as 1982 and has served as the inspiration for a lot of today 's digital games . " the influence of " @entity19 " on video games has been clear from the beginning . " @entity11 was about creativity -- both in terms of the player experience and the @entity29 experience , " @entity118 said . " once i started getting exposed to @entity23 's world -- sitting there and thumbing through the pages of the ' @entity185 ' over and over again and the other manuals of @entity11 , i saw his whole vision . it exposed me to creatively minded people who thought about fantasy and genre things the way i did . it really got the ball rolling for me . " in 1988 , the first officially - licensed video game based on @entity11 was released by @entity201 " @entity200 " was an adaptation of the @entity19 rule set , and was generally well received by fans and critics . more successful video games would follow including the " @entity206 " series and the " @entity205 " collection . holkins played many of the games and felt the games leveraged the vast settings of the @entity11 's campaigns without tying themselves to its specific rules -- thereby leaning more on storytelling rather than combat . " as far as it being an influence on videogames , that 's not even a conversation , " @entity80 said . " in the @entity220 ( computer role - playing games ) tradition , the lineage is so direct as to be a straight line . " and many who play games like " @entity226 , " " @entity231 " and " @entity232 , " often connected to teammates and opponents through headsets and computer chat channels , also gather together for the social experience that is an old - fashioned " @entity11 " session . " @entity19 " sessions are social , @entity118 said . " you are surrounded by your friends and not ( someone ) yelling and cursing at you over their @entity239 headset . " you get to have this really nice experience playing with friends . " @entity80 agrees . " different groups are all playing the same game , theoretically , but in practice there 's a lot of culture that is n't really portable from table to table and people approach it with their own style , " he said . " it would have to be like that , when you think about it . at root , the game is about a group of people who are all agreeing to imagine the same thing . is ' intimate ' the right word ? i think i could make a case . " new @entity11 rules the game itself has evolved over many official and unofficial rule changes in its 40 years . from the original rules in 1974 to " @entity19 " in 1981 up to " @entity270 " released in 2008 , the idea has always been to give players a framework to create adventures the way they want to experience and enjoy them . " there are certain things about the @entity11 game that transcend generations -- the storytelling aspect , the desire to become something greater than yourself or just something different from yourself , " said @entity276 , senior design manager for story and world building for @entity19 . " i think those experiences have given the @entity11 game its longevity because they are timeless . " two years and 170,000 playtesters later , those timeless ideals are implanted in the fifth and latest generation of rules which were announced by @entity49 on monday . a brand new " @entity295 , " " @entity185 , " and " @entity296 " will be released this summer , setting the foundations for the game 's future . in addition to new rules , the creative team at @entity49 announced an original storyline that will extend beyond the tabletop and into digital gaming . @entity303 , a powerful goddess that takes the form of a multi-colored , five - headed dragon , is at the core of the new " @entity310 " tale . a new module for the @entity11 online game , " @entity313 , " will launch on august 14 and be " the premier digital ' @entity19 ' experience for players , " according to a press release . two new tabletop adventures will also be released , one on august 19 and the other on october 21 . a new line of miniatures ( figures that represent player characters and others they encounter ) is also planned to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition of core rules . " we 're aiming to tell the story not only in the role - playing game , but in other venues so that people can experience it at a number of different levels to a number of different depths , " @entity276 said . " we have n't really dealt with dragons much in the ( @entity338 ) over the past 40 years . it 's been a long time since we 've had an iconic villain on the order of @entity303 . " he said the experience will be different depending on what platform you access the story . players will have a shared story , but what actually happens during a tabletop game will be different than in the digital games . while rule changes have usually resulted in the gnashing of teeth and wailing of voices from some players , @entity276 said there is flexibility built in to the new edition so players can play and enjoy whatever type of game they want , using as much or as little of the new system as they want . @entity276 acts as the dungeon master for the @entity364 , adventures at @entity367 conventions and plans to show everyone how the new rules can work . " when i run the game at @entity367 this summer , i 'm going to do it even differently , " he said . " i 'm going to have ' @entity373 ' elements , but i 'm also going to have very strong visuals and there will be miniatures because i 'm going to try to demonstrate without actually calling attention to it that you can present and play the @entity11 game in any one of a number of different ways and it is still @entity19 . " @entity48 and @entity276 believe the future of stories in games will be best told through a transmedia experience and they hope players will usher in a familiar future for @entity11 . it is a sentiment shared by @entity118 and @entity80 . " let 's get a group of friends together and have an adventure , " @entity118 said . " in reality , that 's what the future of video gaming wants to be . it wants to be a place where the player has the ability to be more expressive . "

as " @placeholder " turns 40 , it 's still inspiring gamers
