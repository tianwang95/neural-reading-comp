( @entity0 ) -- when @entity2 learned the @entity3 was coming to @entity4 in 2014 , she thought the good times were soon to return . once the owner of a busy clothing stall , the 59 - year - old @entity7 resident had scraped around for work since her license expired and was n't renewed by city authorities . but now the @entity3 was coming to her home town -- along with many thousands of fans , visitors and tourists -- opportunities would abound , would n't they ? it has n't quite turned out that way . @entity20 may be one of the lucky ones who has been able to secure an official @entity3 job but what she can do and where she can work is limited . alongside roughly 600 others , she has been given permission to sell ice packs and soft drinks outside the @entity7 stadium . only official @entity33 partners are allowed to hock their wares here and within the arena . @entity20 is all too aware that many others have n't been so fortunate . she recalls the days when as many 22,000 stall - owners plied their trade on @entity7 's streets . a mere 600 jobs ( although there are also temporary roles in other areas ) is n't nearly enough for them , she laments . " this @entity3 is not for the @entity4 , " de @entity2 replies when asked whether @entity7 has experienced the boon she expected . " it is for the foreigners and @entity33 friends . " @entity52 protests @entity20 is n't the only disillusioned @entity4 . a recent poll by the @entity54 found that 61 % of respondents felt hosting the @entity3 would be a bad thing for their country . according to @entity59 of the @entity60 of the @entity3 , an umbrella organization for disparate protest groups in the city , the tournament will bring a lot of money into @entity4 , but mainly to a well - connected few . " @entity67 is bringing benefits to @entity4 but it 's to the economic and political elites -- not to street vendors , not to small companies , entrepreneurs and not to workers in general , " she said . key to this debate are the spiraling costs of building new stadia across the country to host matches during the @entity3 . promotional literature released by the @entity4 government puts expenditure in terms of funds , loans and credit lines from the public purse for stadium projects at at $ 3.5 billion . but a recent audit suggests the price has escalated to $ 4.2 billion . " the stadiums are not being built for ordinary people because the price of the tickets is very high and many people will not be able to go watch football any more . " instead , the stadiums are in a way very good for big engineering companies to make money , " @entity98 said . people have also been evicted from their homes to make way for projects relating to the @entity3 and there has been the " pacification " of favelas , which has seen police forcibly occupy some of the poorer neighborhoods in the city , she added . such concerns are far from exclusive to @entity7 . all across @entity4 , street protests have raged in the last year while popular committee groups have also sprung up in @entity117 , @entity118 and beyond . a multitude of grievances , not all directly related to the @entity3 , have driven this discontent -- including rising transport prices , higher living costs , housing concerns and accusations of police brutality . fairness and equality are at the heart of these concerns . while @entity4 has grown rapidly since the turn of the century , creating a new middle class , inequality remains high and some fear the very poorest are being left behind . according to the @entity135 , @entity4 ranks 17th out of 140 countries in terms of the highest levels of income disparity . protesters are asking why an emerging nation is spending billions on hosting a football tournament when that money could be better directed towards alleviating poverty . " it is unacceptable to build a mega event that will provide high profits to @entity33 ... while there are serious problems of social inequality in the country , " said @entity145 , an activist with the student protest group @entity146 . " @entity67 reaffirms an existing logic that rules the @entity4 government . it 's a logic benefiting big businesses and a small elite who occupy the top of the social pyramid , " he added . but with new roads , airports and stadiums being built , all of which have brought jobs and improvements to the country 's infrastructure , there are many who say the initial outlay , however eye - watering , will be worth it in the long term . the @entity4 government estimates that 710,000 temporary and permanent jobs will be created during the tournament while fan spending alone is expected to total $ 13 billion . on top of that , many @entity4 cities see the exposure they will gain hosting matches as an opportunity to position themselves as attractive destinations to potential investors and tourists now and in the future . a @entity3 for all ? " there has been significant investment in urban mobility projects , in airport modernization projects , in port modernization projects , telecommunications infrastructure and security infrastructure , " @entity4 's deputy sports minister @entity191 told @entity0 . " you have to remember that @entity4 is still a developing nation ... as well as providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of @entity4 , these investments will benefit people in terms of the services provided , " he added . " the fans who come to the @entity3 wo n't be taking back with them the new urban transport solutions or airport extensions , " @entity191 said . @entity208 , general supervisor at @entity117 - based think - tank , the @entity210 , agrees with this viewpoint . " in a way , what we are seeing are investments that otherwise do not take place , " he said . " @entity67 has been a kind of catalyst for this . " " the government did not take money from health or transportation to invest in stadiums . investments in public health and transportation will go on and on . " @entity208 is quick to add , however , that this does n't mean public grievances are without merit , and believes the @entity3 has created a platform for groups and people dissatisfied with how @entity4 is developing as to unite and make their voices heard . in recent weeks teachers , metro workers and bus drivers have gone on strike demanding better pay and conditions . others have taken to the streets to campaign for better housing . rather than highlighting the negatives of hosting a football tournament , these protests " are really talking about the other side of economic modernization in @entity4 , " @entity208 said . " @entity67 is not a target per se but it is an opportunity to vocalize and make stronger ... claims for strengthening the process around political and social inclusion . " however , @entity98 and others in protest movements maintain their opposition to the @entity3 is based on principled rejection of spending decisions tied to what they regard as an elitist , closed event . yet , with billions of dollars already spent and the tournament about to start , they are realistic about what opposition can now achieve . still , @entity98 hopes the anger felt by many @entity4 will reach the watching world and provide lessons for future hosts of big sporting events , including the next two @entity3 host countries . " we hope our legacy will be to show to people in @entity276 , @entity277 and maybe in other places that these events and the way they are organized ( make it ) impossible they will bring any benefits , " @entity98 said .
