it 's a typically hot , humid august day in @entity1 -- an ancient town in the heart of @entity5 's central @entity4 . once the capital of the @entity7 , today @entity1 is an expanse of intricate temples and pagodas , erected by the ancient kings in their names and , as the once - isolated country opens up to the world , a major attraction for tourists . outside the @entity18 -- the largest in @entity1 -- a small girl runs up to me smiling , her hair slicked back into a ponytail and her cheeks streaked with tanaka . " madam , ' @entity24 ? ' good book , " she proclaims , pushing a copy of it into my hands . " do you like this book ? " i ask her . " yes , but i only read little bit , " she said , nodding . " my @entity33 not good . this is too difficult for me . but for you good price , madam . " the fact that a girl was gleefully selling me @entity42 's " @entity24 " in broad daylight at a tourist attraction is quite remarkable for @entity5 . heavy - handed government censorship of literature meant that , though the book was always available , it was redacted and frowned upon for its negative portrayal of the @entity5 people . in 2012 , an original translation of the book -- intact and uncut -- was finally awarded a @entity49 . that version of the book is now openly available , marking a big step forward for this country . stifled environment under @entity5 's decades - long military rule that ended up isolating the country from the outside world and squandering its potential as a global player , authorities tried to suppress free thought and dissent by maintaining control over what people read and the information that was available across the country . but the @entity68 library -- a symbol of the country 's colonial rule until it gained independence in 1948 -- was a safe haven of information . for years , visitors could get their hands on books that were banned in the country , including " @entity79 " ( 1930 ) , an obscure novel by @entity81 , and more recently " @entity82 , " ( 1997 ) pro-democracy politician @entity84 's inspiring tale of her years under house arrest . many books were carefully retained and protected by @entity87 , an @entity33 woman who married a @entity5 barrister and moved to the country in 1937 , at a difficult time when marriages between locals and foreigners were frowned upon . in 1962 , @entity5 's first independent government party to take power through elections was ousted in a coup d'Ã©tat by the military , led by @entity100 . as the military consolidated its control , the original @entity68 library was closed down . at that point , @entity103 managed to salvage and move a handful of books into the @entity109 @entity108 building , where the library now lives and has since expanded into a large collection . years later , when the @entity113 finally arrived in @entity5 and the country was still under the control of the military junta , the library was one of the few places where users could access international news and uncensored information , says @entity122 , director of education and arts at the @entity68 . members would even safely hold political discussions and dialogues at the library . " the irony is that we were allowed to keep the library open , " @entity128 adds . scattered education in 1988 , ill - conceived economic policies by the military government sparked protests , led by students and monks , that gripped major cities across the country , particularly in the former capital @entity142 . despite the peaceful nature of the protests , the military cracked down hard . curfews were imposed and universities shuttered as the authorities moved to ban political discussions and gatherings among students that encouraged dissent . most university courses were reduced to distance - learning centers scattered across the country , providing little opportunity to engage with professors and fellow students . " pretty much all undergraduate programs were taken via distance learning . and they were of poor quality : it involved mainly memorizing and regurgitating material , " says @entity128 . the public library system also disintegrated , receiving little funding or attention . a local library i visited in @entity1 was a case in point -- bookshelves creaking under the weight of unloved , mildew - covered books , most of them obscure and unrecognizable . according to a survey by the @entity181 , almost 90 % of books at libraries such as this one are religious texts . " a lot of libraries are still closed or not up to date . they are usually very heavily reliant on book donations and a lot of those donations are irrelevant , " says @entity128 . yet , people were gathered inside and outside the building , reading newspapers , chatting and using the free ( extremely patchy ) wifi offered there . it was clearly a communal spot for the town . signs of @entity197 in a way , the state and evolution of libraries and literature is a litmus test of @entity5 's development and change since the military leadership formally stepped aside in 2011 -- as the new translation of " @entity24 " shows . in 2012 , @entity84 established the non-profit @entity209 -- mobile libraries set up to compensate for the crumbling libraries . vans bring a collection of over 15,000 books to the more remote areas of the country , encouraging people of all ages to delve into the literary world . another milestone came in december last year when @entity221 started to take undergraduates on campus again -- the first time since the crackdown , breathing new life into the abandoned institution . owing to the neglected state of the university 's library , an " e-library " was introduced in january this year , allowing unprecedented access to thousands of up - to - date journals , textbooks and novels from organizations around the world , such as the @entity238 and @entity239 journals databases . " the first time i actually went to @entity221 in june last year , the campus was dead . there was not a single student in sight , the library materials were old , the furniture was stacked up , " says @entity128 . " but a lot has changed in a year . " seeking to catch up with the outside world in economic terms , the civilian government has embraced the need for widespread education and freedom of thought . and investing in its human capital by slowly bolstering the libraries and universities across this vast country that were on once the verge of collapse is key to this .

libraries in smaller towns such as @placeholder became a meeting place for local population
