@entity0 in @entity1 have begun their most forceful push yet in urging president @entity3 to begin a military campaign into @entity5 to defeat the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity5 . " one of the key decisions the president is going to have to make is air power in @entity5 . we can not give ( @entity15 ) a base of operations , " sen. @entity12 , @entity13 , said on " @entity14 . " for nearly three years , @entity3 has refused to engage in a complicated civil war in @entity5 where different factions are fighting each other and attempting to topple president @entity21 . the president has actively defended his decision to not get involved in the war - torn country . but now that @entity15 , which gained prominence and power in @entity5 , is expanding its scope , the domestic calls for the president to act in @entity5 are loud . conservatives pushing for military action dominated the sunday political talk shows less than one week after an @entity15 militant with a @entity36 accent beheaded @entity38 journalist @entity37 in a video of his killing . " i do n't want to hear from the president about how he 's reacting to events , " @entity38 rep. @entity41 , @entity42 , said on @entity43 ' " @entity46 . " " i want to hear a strategy how he 's going to fend @entity15 off . " is @entity3 heading toward airstrikes in @entity5 ? sen. @entity50 , @entity42 - @entity51 , said on @entity53 's " @entity52 " that it is to " @entity38 's peril " if @entity15 is not stopped . " it 's about time now to assume the worst about these guys , rather than to be underestimating them , " he said . defense secretary @entity58 gave a stark assessment of @entity15 on thursday , indicating the terror group , which has expanded its grip to western @entity7 , needs to be addressed . " this is beyond anything that we 've seen . so we must prepare for everything . and the only way you do that is you take a cold , steely , hard look at it and get ready , " @entity66 said . at the same news conference , gen. @entity72 , chairman of the @entity73 , said the @entity38 is going to expand its reach to address @entity15 . he refused , however , to confirm that the @entity38 would conduct airstrikes in @entity5 . " it requires a variety of instruments , only one small part of which is airstrikes . i 'm not predicting those will occur in @entity5 , at least not by the @entity38 . but it requires the application of all of the tools of national power -- diplomatic , economic , information , military , " he told reporters thursday . @entity50 said the @entity38 must do everything it can to defeat @entity15 , even if that means @entity38 ground troops become engaged . " if our military commanders tell us that we need ground forces to defeat @entity15 , which is a threat to the @entity38 , so be it , " he said . but sen. @entity97 of @entity98 , the only @entity99 to appear on the sunday shows to talk about @entity15 , pushed back against the idea that @entity38 troops should enter into another ground war . " the most effective use of our force is not putting troops on the ground , but using capable troops like @entity108 with ( @entity38 ) airstrikes , " @entity97 said . threat to the @entity38 the @entity0 lawmakers said their calls for expanded military action are justified because @entity15 poses an " imminent threat " to the @entity38 . " we should , in my view , look at @entity15 as a direct threat to the @entity38 , " @entity50 said , using the alternate name for @entity15 . @entity50 's assessment mirrors all of the other top @entity0 who appeared on political talk shows sunday , who insisted that @entity15 is capable of committing an attack on @entity38 soil . " i do think they present the greatest threat we 've seen since 9/11 , " rep. @entity123 , @entity124 , said on @entity126 's " @entity125 . " @entity15 siege cuts off small @entity7 town from food , water top military officials issued dire warnings about the severity of @entity15 and their mission but stopped short of saying @entity15 posed an immediate , direct threat to the @entity38 . @entity72 described their mission as " apocalyptic , " and @entity66 called the threat " imminent ... to every interest we have . " @entity123 , the chairman of the @entity142 , said he believes an attack on the @entity38 is in the works . " they would love more than nothing else to hit the @entity38 , " he added . rep. @entity147 , @entity148 @entity0 and chairman of the @entity150 , said the estimated 100 @entity15 fighters who are @entity38 citizens and " thousands " that hold @entity154 passports make it easy for the trained militants to enter into the @entity38 . " they are one plane ticket away from @entity38 shores , " @entity147 said on @entity158 's " @entity157 . " @entity97 , a top @entity161 member on the @entity162 , however , softened the immediacy of the threat . " but to jump from what they have done , which is horrific , particularly the murder of mr. @entity37 , to the assumption that they 're going to be an immediate and within days a threat to us here in our homeland , i think you do n't jump to that assumption , but you do n't dismiss it , " he said on " @entity52 . " but @entity50 fired back : " here is the question . can @entity38 be safe if @entity15 is not defeated ? i do n't think we can . " criticism of @entity3 republicans blamed the president for the expansion of @entity15 , saying the terror groups ' dominance stems from a lack of inaction in @entity5 when that country 's civil war broke out nearly three years ago . " i am heartbroken ... about what has happened to the @entity5 people and a lot of that is due to our total inaction . and it 's going to be one of the more shameful chapters in @entity38 history , " @entity12 said . @entity38 held in @entity5 is released sen. @entity198 of @entity199 said the president 's limited foreign policy is no longer acceptable . " the containment aspect of it is not going to defeat them , " @entity198 said on @entity43 ' " @entity46 . " @entity123 echoed that same sentiment : " i do n't think you 're going to win this with a containment policy alone . this administration thus far has only dealt with containment . " " this is an opportunity for the president to take a step back , change his presidential guidance , " @entity147 said . @entity1 ' role members of @entity1 have not yet expressed concern that the @entity3 administration has acted unilaterally by launching nearly 100 airstrikes in northern @entity7 . more concerning to @entity0 are cuts to the defense budget that cost more than half a trillion dollars , or 10 % of its budget , over 10 years as part of an effort to reduce overall government spending . @entity12 said his " his first goal " when @entity1 returns to @entity231 in september is to repeal reduction to the defense budget . @entity198 agreed . " there 's a disconnect with sequester from the threats that we face around the world and the resources we are going to need to fight this threat , " she said .
