freed from prison , former @entity1 prime minister @entity0 returned saturday to the battleground capital the same day the country 's president said he left @entity6 because of a " coup . " @entity0 's release was the latest in a day of dramatic , fast - paced developments that saw @entity11 vote to remove president @entity12 from office and call for new elections . " today , @entity1 has finished with this terrible dictator , mr. @entity12 , " @entity0 told a cheering crowd of thousands in @entity6 's @entity16 , the scene of deadly demonstrations . just hours after her release from a prison hospital , @entity0 called for justice for protesters killed in demonstrations sparked by the president 's decision to scrap a trade deal with the @entity28 in favor of one with @entity30 . " you were able to change @entity1 , and you can do everything , " she told the crowd . " everyone has a right to take part in building a @entity38 , independent state . " but @entity12 took to television airwaves , saying he had been forced to leave @entity6 because of " vandalism , crime and a coup . " " i do n't plan to leave the country . i do n't plan to resign . i am the legitimate president , " he said in an interview from @entity45 , a @entity46 stronghold near @entity1 's border with that nation . " ... what i am going to do next is to protect my country from the split , to stop the bloodshed . i do n't know how to do it yet . i am in @entity45 and i do n't know what i am going to do next . " he did not address reports that he attempted to leave the country by airplane . according to the head of @entity1 's @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity12 and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of @entity66 . he was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces , @entity61 told @entity69 , confirming an account he gave to @entity1 's @entity72 news agency . in that account , @entity61 said border security had approached the plane to check paperwork , and an armed group of people on the plane attempted to offer money to the inspectors to allow the flight to take off . when the inspectors refused the money , @entity12 and others in his entourage exited the plane and got into two vehicles that drove up on the tarmac , @entity61 is quoted as saying . @entity1 's dismissed interior minister , @entity89 , also was refused exit from the country in a similar incident at the same airport , @entity61 said . the events of the day raise questions about just who is in control in @entity1 , with @entity11 voting to oust @entity12 and hold new elections on may 25 . the vote came just 24 hours after @entity12 signed a peace deal with the opposition intended to end days of bloody protests . ' people 's residence ' at the presidential residence in a @entity6 suburb , the president 's living quarters were vacant , his guards gone . government buildings , protest gatherings and the central city were devoid of police and security forces , who had opened fire on protesters this week , killing dozens . track how the crisis in @entity1 unfolded as a @entity69 crew drove to @entity12 's residence , it passed checkpoints set up by protesters . when the crew arrived , the gatekeepers said they were not allowing the general public onto the grounds , but they let journalists enter . the civil servants asked that the reporters treat his home as a crime scene and referred to it as the " people 's residence . " but not everyone in @entity1 was happy with the news . the country is ethnically split , with many ethnic @entity30 living in the east . the rest comprises mostly ethnic @entity1 . in several cities , people have toppled statues of @entity144 , a founder of the @entity145 . the communist empire had included @entity1 until it gained independence in 1991 after the fall of the @entity145 . in a sign of the deep divisions , government supporters took to the streets saturday night in @entity45 to protect a monument to @entity144 that anti-government protesters threatened to tear down . police in riot gear stood between the two sides , while others erected a temporary fence around the monument . freeing @entity0 in the @entity162 , @entity1 's @entity11 , lawmakers passed a resolution to free @entity0 , a hero of the country 's 2004 revolution that forced the questionable results of a presidential election won by @entity12 to be thrown out . @entity0 served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010 , and was forced out of office after losing an election to @entity12 . she was sentenced in 2011 to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with @entity30 in 2009 . the case against her was widely considered to have been politically motivated , and the @entity177 and other @entity179 nations called her " a political prisoner . " in 2012 , after she was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards , she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to " violence and lack of rights " in her country . in @entity190 , @entity189 press secretary @entity188 said @entity177 officials were closely monitoring developments . " we have consistently advocated a de-escalation of violence , constitutional change , a coalition government , and early elections , and today 's developments could move us closer to that goal , " he said in a statement . @entity30 's ambassador to the @entity202 , @entity201 , condemned what he called @entity179 attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in @entity1 . " either they do n't understand the consequences of what they 're doing , or they 're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing @entity1 and therefore @entity215 , " @entity201 said in a post on his official @entity209 account . a day earlier , @entity201 accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force . " if those so - called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs that will not produce democracy in @entity1 , " he said . by saturday , a tidal wave of political change appeared to be engulfing @entity1 with key @entity12 allies leaving office , and the presidential duties being handed off until a new cabinet has been selected . during the parliamentary session , resignations were announced for the speaker and another leading presidential ally . hours later , @entity11 elected a new speaker , a rival to @entity12 , and gave him the duty of coordinating the executive office until a new cabinet is in place . another opposition parliamentarian received the duties of acting interior minister . the @entity162 sacked @entity12 's prosecutor general . discord 's roots the unrest began in november , when @entity12 scrapped a @entity28 trade deal and turned toward @entity30 . @entity30 , which has offered to lend money to cash - strapped @entity1 in a deal worth billions of dollars and to lower its gas prices , has pressured @entity12 to crack down on demonstrators . @entity179 leaders , who have offered @entity1 a long - term aid package requiring economic modernization , urged him to show restraint , open the government to the opposition and let the democratic process work out deep - seated political differences . but the fight was also about corruption and control . the opposition called @entity12 heavy - handed , with protesters saying they would n't leave @entity16 until he resigned . tensions boiled over tuesday , when security forces charged into a @entity6 crowd with stun grenades , nightsticks and armored personnel carriers . the violence escalated , leaving dozens -- protesters and police alike -- dead . explainer : what and who are behind @entity1 's political crisis ? @entity278 : protester describes bloodied people being rushed to medics @entity177 talks tough , but options limited in @entity1
