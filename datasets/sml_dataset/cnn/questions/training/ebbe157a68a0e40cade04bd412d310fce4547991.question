a jury in @entity1 convicted a former peanut company owner friday of conspiracy , fraud and other federal charges in a groundbreaking case stemming from a deadly salmonella outbreak almost six years ago . the guilty verdict marks the first federal felony conviction for a company executive in a food safety case . prosecutor @entity12 said he hopes the trial will send a strong message to the food industry that its officials are now on notice that they 'll be held accountable for foodborne illnesses . the jury 's verdict came after a seven - week trial for @entity22 and his brother and food broker , @entity25 , both charged with 76 federal counts linked to intentionally shipping out salmonella - laced peanut products . @entity25 was also found guilty on multiple counts . a third defendant , former plant quality control manager @entity30 , was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice . the @entity25 brothers , @entity12 said , " could easily spend the rest of their lives in prison . " both men were taken into custody pending sentencing . @entity41 was set at $ 150,000 for @entity22 and $ 100,000 for his brother , @entity12 said . a sentencing date has not been set . @entity22 's lawyer , @entity44 , said he will appeal the verdict . " we think it was the wrong decision and we will continue to fight on behalf of @entity22 , " he said . @entity48 , whose mother , @entity49 , died after she ate peanut butter that came from @entity25 's processing plant , @entity52 , said he felt relief as the clerk began to read the verdict . he had prepared to hear the worst -- that the @entity56 would be acquitted . instead , he heard the word " guilty " over and over again . " it was validation , " said @entity49 , who traveled from @entity58 to @entity1 for the trial . " it was emotional . " after about the 14th " guilty , " the words began to fade and @entity49 thought of his mother , who died four days before @entity66 in 2008 . " i do n't think these people are devils , " he said , " but they let greed take over their morals . " food safety lawyers also applauded the jury 's decision . " if anybody deserved it , he did , " @entity58 - based trial lawyer @entity75 said of @entity22 . " i am not at all surprised he was found guilty given the evidence against him , " said @entity75 , who represented some of the victims of the outbreak . federal prosecutors presented more than 1,000 documents and called 45 witnesses to the stand to make their case that @entity25 , his brother and @entity30 cut corners on safety in order to make a bigger profit for @entity52 they were accused of covering up lab results that tested positive for salmonella in their peanut products . the prosecution 's blistering opening statement contained three now - infamous words @entity22 penned in a march 2007 email to a plant manager about tainted products : " just ship it . " defense statements and witnesses , which took all of 104 minutes , portrayed @entity25 as a small business owner who was scapegoated by the government . at one point , the jury was shown a photograph of peanut butter made at @entity52 sitting on @entity25 's dining table at home . defense attorneys said @entity25 would not have had the peanut butter in his own home had he known it to be compromised . the trial opened august 1 in @entity118 , @entity1 , less than an hour 's drive from the @entity52 plant in the small town of @entity122 , raided and shuttered in 2009 by federal food inspectors . the 2008 - 2009 salmonella outbreak killed nine people , sickened at least 714 others nationwide and resulted in a huge food recall that cast a pall over one of @entity131 's favorite foods : peanut butter . food safety advocates said the trial was groundbreaking because it 's so rare corporate executives are held accountable in court for bacteria in food . never before had a jury heard a criminal case in which a corporate chief faced federal felony charges for knowingly shipping out food containing salmonella . @entity75 praised public health officials whose sleuth work eventually traced the outbreak 's origins back to the @entity52 plant in @entity122 . " i do n't view ( @entity25 's ) conduct as any different than poisoning people or drunk driving , " @entity75 said . " my strong suspicion is that this happens much more often than is known . " however , @entity25 and his co-defendants were not on trial for poisoning people or causing any deaths stemming from the outbreak , and prosecutors did not mention the deaths to the jury . @entity162 , a @entity164 food safety lawyer who also represented several victims of the outbreak , said the government would have had the added burden of proving the deaths were linked to @entity25 had they mentioned them . those facts were not necessary , @entity162 said , to prove the charges at hand . @entity162 said he hopes friday 's verdict will send a message to corporations that they can not get away with this kind of behavior . the prosecution was unprecedented , @entity162 said , because the @entity180 charged the @entity25 brothers with felonies . prior cases involved misdemeanors . " prosecutors took a risk and fortunately , the jury believed them , " @entity162 said . " the jury saw this for what it was . the emails and documents told a story of a company that was more interested in shipping out products than products that were safe . " @entity196 is @entity131 's most common cause of foodborne illness and sickens up to 1.4 million people every year . former employees of @entity52 described filthy conditions at the @entity1 plant . federal inspectors found roaches , rats , mold , dirt , accumulated grease and bird droppings during their raid . they also found a leaky roof . @entity196 is often associated with meat , poultry , eggs and raw milk -- products from animals that are carriers of the bacteria . it also thrives in the intestines of birds and can be found in fruits and vegetables and in ingredients made from them . the presence of water in what is supposed to be a dry processing facility for peanuts is like adding gasoline to fire for salmonella , food safety experts say . health officials discovered similar poor conditions at @entity52 's other processing plant in @entity237 , @entity238 . the company filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy shortly after it was shut down . two former plant managers worked out deals with the government in exchange for their testimonies against @entity25 . follow @entity247 's @entity246 on @entity248 .
