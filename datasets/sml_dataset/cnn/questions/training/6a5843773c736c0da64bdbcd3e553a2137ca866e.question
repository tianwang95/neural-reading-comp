( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 won the @entity2 for the first time in its history as an extra-time goal from midfielder @entity6 gave his country a last - gasp 1 - 0 victory over the @entity9 in the final at @entity11 . the showpiece game of the @entity14 - hosted tournament on sunday was littered with no less than 14 yellow cards and one red but was settled by a moment of magic by the @entity20 man after he was played in by substitute @entity21 . his 116th - minute strike was the goal all @entity24 were waiting for and spared both sides the agony of deciding the new world champions by penalties . the breakthrough came after the @entity30 had been reduced to 10 men , following @entity33 's dismissal in the second half of extra time by referee @entity36 for a foul on @entity6 . " it 's incredible , " @entity6 told gathered media in a post-match news conference . " what a joy especially when you see how we won it . there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . after my goal , i thought about my family and all the people who i love . but the victory is the fruit of a lot of work , " an emotional @entity6 told reporters . @entity1 coach @entity58 added to the happy sentiment following his side 's victory : " today is a reward for beautiful football . everyone in the dressing room is ecstatic , " he said . @entity66 , who won two @entity68 cups when in charge of club side @entity70 , dedicated the win to his countrymen . " @entity1 , the country , deserves this triumph . this goes beyond sport . we have to celebrate and are delighted to be able to offer this victory to all the people of @entity1 . " @entity66 said it had been a pleasure to coach the side , which with the win adds the @entity2 to its @entity68 crown . " there is joy of being 50 days with this group of players who have given us the world title . it was a difficult match . afterwards , i think that we were slightly better , " he added . the coach also refused to be drawn into criticizing the tough tackling of the @entity9 : " i 'm here to speak about the beautiful things of football . @entity9 played a good game in an even , balanced match . yes it was rough at times , but that is part of football . " for the @entity24 came joy , but for the @entity30 , desolation . the @entity9 lost its third appearance in a @entity2 final , after previous defeats in the 1974 and 1978 . two second - half chances went begging for star player @entity108 . the flying winger was sent clear by @entity110 , only to be denied by a superb save from @entity1 captain @entity111 , who stuck out a leg to send the ball wide . late in normal time @entity108 was also through and appeared to be pulled back by @entity1 defender @entity114 before @entity111 saved again at his feet . @entity1 had great chances in the second half with @entity118 denied by the legs of @entity33 , and @entity120 who headed over with the goal at his mercy . at the end of normal time , the game remained scoreless , as the dropping temperatures and deadlock in the match served to quiet the sell - out crowd in the @entity11 . in extra-time , @entity1 pressed forward with yet more urgency and @entity21 was put through by @entity6 only for goalkeeper @entity132 to deny him with a smart save . with the game opening up , @entity134 was nearly an unlikely scorer for the @entity30 while @entity1 substitute @entity136 saw his shot deflected into the side netting . but in the second half of extra-time , the goal chances dried up until @entity6 cropped up to score the winner . substitute @entity143 , who later pulled up in agony clutching his hamstring , played in the initial ball . it was poorly cleared , falling to @entity21 , who sent a neat pass through to his teammate @entity6 , who had cleverly stayed onside . the @entity30 angrily protested @entity36 should have awarded an earlier foul , but he waved the protests away and was soon signaling the end of an eventful final , marred by persistent fouling that broke up the natural rhythm of the game . a chest - high tackle in the first half by @entity161 , which left @entity1 midfielder @entity163 nursing bruised ribs , might have earned a red card , while @entity167 also escaped harsher punishment after another thumping challenge . @entity30 coach @entity170 -- who lost out on the chance to have become the first coach since 1970 to have led a side through @entity2 qualifying and the finals unbeaten -- conceded @entity1 had deserved to win . " the best team won . i am disappointed . early on we gave chances away , we were not good enough in possession of the ball . but then we turned it around . we made a real game out of it and we had two great chances through @entity108 [ @entity108 ] . " it is very bitter , but that is sport . it is harsh . @entity1 were the better team , " he told reporters after the game . in @entity204 , the capital of the @entity9 , most of the hundreds of thousands of people who 'd gathered in the @entity198 square to watch the game on a giant screen filtered out in stunned silence after the final whistle , leaving behind trampled orange hats and a smattering of tearful people sitting on crates with their heads in their hands . " i thought we could hang on till the penalties , and then it would have been 50 - 50 , " said a man in his 30s , wearing face paint in the colors of the @entity30 flag . a woman in her early 20s had an expression that veered between a smile and a frown . " we really thought we could do it , " she said . " it was tough to watch , and it feels tough now . " back in @entity14 , @entity226 defended the tactics that had seen his side regularly penalized by the referee : " it is not our style , but then again you play a match to win . it is a @entity2 final , and there is a lot of emotion -- you saw that at the end of the match . " i would have loved to win the match , even with not so beautiful football . i 'm not someone to look back on the what the referee did . i think the best team usually wins the match , " he added .
