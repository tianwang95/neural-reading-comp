( @entity0 ) -- recently , the chairman of the @entity4 bishops ' @entity2 argued that the @entity7 administration 's requirement that most health insurance plans cover contraception goes against " the mandate of @entity11 . " but @entity11 said nothing about contraception coverage , of course , or most any other issues related to sexuality . so , what is the issue ? the current mandate would require that @entity21 institutions like universities and hospitals include coverage for contraception and sterilization , although it exempts @entity21 parishes . official @entity21 teaching is against contraception and sterilization . but this issue goes beyond internal @entity32 concerns and moves into the public arena . the @entity4 catholic bishops and other conservative @entity37 groups have argued that the @entity7 administration 's requirement wars with religious liberty and the role of conscience . last sunday , at least 100 bishops had letters read at masses in their dioceses imploring @entity32 to oppose this coverage . newspapers have carried stories of @entity21 bishops making apocalyptic predictions that @entity21 universities and hospitals would have to close their doors if this coverage is allowed . but who is really making this argument besides the bishops and a minority of conservative @entity32 and @entity60 , especially when studies show that 98 % of sexually active @entity21 women have used contraceptives ? @entity63 , a brief history . since the 1930s and the @entity67 of the @entity68 , most christian denominations have allowed for contraceptives , leaving the decision up to married couples . the @entity32 rejected that position , standing relatively alone on the issue , and has allowed , since 1951 , only the rhythm method for birth control ( this is now called natural family planning ) . when the @entity32 went through changes in the 1960s , during the @entity80 , or @entity80 ( 1962 - 1965 ) , the pope formed a committee outside of the council to evaluate the stand against contraceptives . the result : 75 out of 90 on the committee recommended that the church allow for contraceptives for married couples . even so , in 1968 , pope @entity88 issued the encyclical ( papal document ) @entity89 ( @entity91 ) , in which he rejected the conclusion of the committee and maintained the church 's opposition to contraception for married couples . immediately , @entity21 theologians issued a statement disagreeing with the encyclical , arguing against its methods and conclusions , and maintaining that @entity32 may act responsibly by following their well - informed consciences on the issue . since that time , studies have shown that most @entity21 couples use some form of contraception . most catholic theologians ( professors of theology at colleges and universities ) reject the church 's teaching on the issue , and have argued that a teaching that the majority of the faithful have rejected is not valid . those are historical facts . fast - forward to now , when the bishops and other @entity37 groups are appealing to the role of " conscience , " a concept on which the bishops themselves and recent popes have put little emphasis , in contrast to the role of " obedience . " if they are going to appeal to conscience , then they must also respect the consciences of responsible adults -- catholic women and men , and non-catholics who work at @entity21 institutions . they must respect the role of parents to decide how many children they can have , and can afford to take care of . no one is forcing @entity32 to take contraceptives . it is a question of access , and hence , of justice . they must also respect the role of @entity32 to share their expertise in health care and in public policy , as @entity80 argued . catholic theologians and other professors at academic universities have the responsibility to search for truth and to work for justice . the catholic moral tradition has long argued that there is a difference between morality and public policy . there is another messy side to this . the @entity32 argues that human life must be protected from the moment of conception . therefore , contraception that works after conception to prevent implantation ( around six to 10 days after conception ) , such as with the @entity175 , would be considered as a category of abortion . so , while the @entity7 legislation does not require abortion coverage , that " abortion language " has also been a part of the @entity21 argument . this seems fair enough to those who would argue that a pre-implanted fertilized egg should be protected from the time of conception . but would the majority of @entity32 oppose contraceptive coverage that works before conception ? and should n't women be allowed to make that decision ? would most @entity32 and @entity60 deny health care coverage for women because of this ? so here is the question , as i see it , as a @entity21 theologian and lifelong @entity21 , educated almost entirely at @entity21 institutions , and taught to work for human dignity , the common good and social justice : should the @entity4 bishops speak for all @entity32 on a matter of national public policy , an issue that most @entity32 disagree on within their own church ? the bishops have refused to discuss this issue with their fellow catholics for more than 40 years . and the bishops are all male . what about @entity21 theologians , academics , social workers and health care professionals ? what about @entity21 women ? what about the 98 % ? public policy involves discussion , dialogue , debate , and sometimes even compromise . that does not mean compromising one 's moral principles , but it may involve compromising how those principles are legislated as a matter of public policy in a pluralistic and democratic society . join the conversation on @entity236 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .

@placeholder : should bishops speak for all @entity32 on a public policy on which most disagree with them ?
