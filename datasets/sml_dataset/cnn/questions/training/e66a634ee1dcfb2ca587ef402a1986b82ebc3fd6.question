( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 's @entity1 , which hits stores in the @entity4 and @entity5 next wednesday , is much more than just another portable gaming device . with the @entity1 , @entity2 is trying to combine the power of its @entity1 home console with the interface , portability and social media features of a smartphone . with its innovative touch controls , @entity15 screen , motion sensors , social apps , gps capability and dual cameras , it has most of the bells and whistles that today 's gamers could want . some industry observers question whether gamers will spring $ 250 - $ 300 for another portable gaming device -- plus potential monthly fees for a 3g data plan -- when smartphones already handle many of the same gaming functions . but @entity2 is counting on the @entity1 's appeal to hard - core action - and first - person shooter gamers who want a designated mobile gaming system , not just another gadget on which to play " @entity37 . " @entity0 spent a week testing out the @entity1 on a handful of games . our verdict : it 's a powerful and promising device -- better suited to some games than to others -- whose ultimate success will depend on whether developers make enough worthy games for it . a social device the successor to the @entity52 hand - held console , @entity1 was started three years ago at the @entity53 by a team led by @entity55 , who designed the original @entity56 . the goal was to bring richer and better gaming enjoyment than was available with the @entity52 . while members of the development team knew they 'd be making upgrades to the hardware and gameplay , @entity59 , president of @entity60 , said he knew social media capability was going to be just as important . " it has @entity68 . it has @entity70 . portable music applications . these are here to enhance your gameplay experience , " @entity59 told @entity0 . " what ( @entity68 ) does as a player is , it lets you take a screen shot of a game you are playing . you beat the boss or you get the high score , ( and ) you can show the world what you 've done with that screen shot . " other social media applications , like @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , will also be available for download . the processing power in the @entity1 allows for eight different applications to run simultaneously . during our hands - on experience , we could download a new game while playing another and listening to music from the media player . there was no detectible slowing of the action or the music . @entity1 also raises the bar on mobile gaming by offering voice chat and text chat through the @entity108 application . party is n't tied into specific games , but allows players to communicate with their friends no matter what each person is doing . however , @entity115 , the exclusive broadband provider for the @entity1 in the @entity4 , does impose some restrictions . @entity59 said voice chat will only work if one person is on a @entity121 connection and the other is on a @entity124 connection . as he reminded us , the @entity1 is n't a phone . do n't have many @entity128 friends online ? @entity1 can help you find new connections with @entity131 , a program that uses gps to search your area for other nearby @entity1 devices . you can see what other people are playing , maybe join up for a multiplayer match or challenge a friend to top your high score . if you 're concerned about privacy , there are ways to block your location , yet still see what 's going on around you . other features all these additions to the gaming experience mean little if the core gameplay is lacking . and that 's where the @entity1 really delivers . the seven - inch device is chock full of processing power , multiple controls and a 5 - inch @entity15 ( organic light - emitting diode ) screen , all designed to make games look and play as well as they do on a @entity1 home console . the front of the @entity1 has two analog joysticks , a first for a portable gaming device , as well as a directional pad and four buttons . the front screen is also a touchscreen , allowing for direct control during a game . the back of the device is a touchpad , which can create some unintended gaming consequences when gripping the @entity1 . because @entity2 wanted the back screen to have a one - to - one relationship with the game action , the rear touchpad takes up the same amount of room as the front screen . but it takes some creative holding of the device to play some games without accidentally tapping on the back . @entity59 said that while @entity1 does have a lot of input devices and functions , there were many others that did n't make it to the final design . he said the team focused on three things for the @entity1 : the size of the device , the price and its battery life . " a certain group of us wanted a stylus , " he said , laughing , about one feature that did n't make the cut . there are also two cameras , front and back , that are designed more for augmented reality ( @entity209 ) gameplay than for taking quality pictures of your vacation spots . three games that take advantage of augmented reality -- using a camera to overlay real - world objects onto a device 's digital screen -- will be available at launch next week . games to consumers , all these features wo n't mean much if there are n't good games to play . available at launch will be 25 titles , with many others scheduled for release shortly after . @entity2 is counting on some big franchises to help the @entity1 make a splash in the @entity4 " @entity233 , " " @entity234 , " " @entity235 , " " @entity236 , " " @entity237 " and " @entity238 " are a few of the powerhouse series that are developing games for the @entity1 . some are available now , and others are coming soon . @entity2 also is making some original games , mainly shooters and action - adventure titles , available at launch . at a recent demo in @entity249 , the new " @entity250 12 : @entity255 " showed how gamers can use the @entity1 's rear touchpad to throw the ball around a baseball diamond . designer @entity256 said the @entity258 version of the game will have 70 new enhancements and @entity1 will have 65 of those as well . he explained that the @entity258 version and the @entity1 version of the game were designed with cross-play between the two consoles in mind . " you dump 20 , 30 , 40 hours into a mode , and it 's time to go on a business trip , " @entity256 said . " you save that file up into a cloud . pick up your @entity1 . take it on the road . download it from the @entity273 and you keep going . and it works vice versa . " after about a week of hands - on experience , the @entity1 feels less like a mobile gaming device and more like a new gaming console that is also portable . the social features and functionality are exciting , and their integration into games seems smooth . it takes a period of adjustment to avoid tapping the backside touchpad at the wrong time during a game . even using the front touchscreen requires a bit of juggling , but it is n't anything that gets frustrating or awkward . overall , the @entity1 's power , social integration and presentation make the device worth a look . but the lingering question is whether developers will create enough great @entity1 games to make it worth the money . the @entity121 version of the @entity1 will cost $ 249 , while the @entity124 version will sell for $ 299 ( plus a data plan ) . two monthly data plans are available through @entity115 : @entity309 for $ 15 and @entity310 for $ 30 . there 's also a first - edition bundle package that includes a @entity314 model , @entity316 memory card , " @entity318 " game and a limited - edition case for $ 350 . the deal expires at the end of march . memory cards are needed for some @entity1 games , but not for all .

our verdict : @placeholder is a promising device whose success will depend on quality of its games
