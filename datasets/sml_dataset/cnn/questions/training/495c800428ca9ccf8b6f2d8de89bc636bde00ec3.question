( @entity0 ) -- underwhelmed . that , in a word , was the response in many quarters to @entity6 's rollout of two new iphones on tuesday . with the @entity10 , the industry 's leading smartphone got a quicker processor , better camera and new fingerprint security scanner . with the @entity15 , it got less expensive and more colorful . and yet , from the internet to @entity17 , @entity6 got savaged mercilessly . " much - hyped @entity10 announcements from the tech giant did little to stop ( @entity6 's ) year - long descent into stagnation , " wrote @entity18 in @entity19 , a @entity0 content partner . " though the faster , sleeker , more powerful phone is unarguably cool , the steps forward are still incremental . and incremental is n't what the world expects from @entity6 . " even @entity30 , whose spot - on satire can sometimes be a brutal contact sport , mocked @entity6 ceo @entity35 's presentation with a story headlined , " @entity37 . " " the white , ultrathin man , who exhibited such features as artificial excitement , a fully quavering voice , and what appeared to be a near total lack of inspiration , was put on full display for thousands of shareholders , industry insiders , reporters , and fans today in what @entity6 hopes will be a game - changer for the multinational corporation , " read the article . add to that a chorus of tongue - clucking from an oft - skeptical tech blogosphere , the short - form snark of @entity55 , sideswipes from competitors and jitters on @entity17 , and you 're a long way away from the fantastical " reality distortion field " that @entity64 famously conjured whenever he pitched a new idea or product to an adoring world . but is all this criticism fair ? @entity69 to make a splash to some , @entity6 is a victim of its own success . after revolutionizing mobile technology with the @entity74 , @entity10 and @entity75 , unveiling a device that feels more like an upgrade than a game - changer may feel to loyal fans like a breach of trust . " when a company has positioned itself on the foundation of innovation , the idea of not innovating in a new product introduction can be a commercial nightmare , " said @entity81 , an associate professor of marketing at @entity82 . " @entity6 has consistently bet the house on innovation , and has a great winning record in the past 15 years . for them to introduce a ' me too ' product is against what they stand for ... . " this is not to say that the new phone is not good . its quality is fine , " @entity81 told @entity0 . " but to develop a new product that is in violation of their stated brand association is inconsistent . " technically , there were smartphones before the @entity10 and tablets before the @entity75 . but by fine - tuning design concepts and making them accessible to the mass market , @entity6 established itself as a hothouse for cutting - edge consumer technology . but tuesday 's iphones were the seventh and eighth versions of the aging iconic device . after six years on the market , some say there 's simply no way the @entity10 can cause a seismic shift in smartphone technology every 12 months . " it 's really easy for people to be disappointed and be critical and you 're looking at @entity55 and all these tech people , they 're ripping @entity6 ... , " tech writer @entity121 , of @entity122 , said to @entity0 's @entity123 . " yes , they are less exciting . @entity35 is not @entity64 . we 're not in a situation where they roll out the next big thing and surprise us at the end of the presentation . we have to come to grips with that . we have to live with that . " adds @entity139 's @entity138 : " the magic 's gone out of the smartphone business , leaving companies and their advocates to argue about slightly faster processors , more megapixels , or slightly improved battery life . that 's progress , but it 's the equivalent of three yards and a cloud of dust . " smartphones ... belong a maturing industry , which means that it 's going to get harder and harder for any company -- @entity6 , @entity155 , or any other would - be challenger -- to make a splash . " innovation in new forms ? in other words , competition changes expectations . during its first few years of existence , the smartphone market was basically the @entity10 and a handful of competitors trying desperately to catch up with the @entity10 . now , while it remains the top - selling handset , the @entity10 only accounts for about 17 % of the world 's smartphones . phones running @entity173 's @entity172 operating system come in an array of sizes and styles and with a plethora of features . " there is always room for ' wow ! ' but , the fact is that when someone does wow the market , over time that feature or benefit becomes a ' must have ' for the industry , " said @entity82 's @entity81 . " it takes very little time until all brands offer that feature or benefit , and it goes from " wow " to being the ante to play in the game . " @entity194 , a tech analyst with @entity195 , says that the true quantum leaps for tech companies probably wo n't be in smartphones anymore . instead , she says , most innovation will come in wearable tech , integrated television and other areas where @entity6 and its rivals are said to be at work on developing new products . @entity194 rejects the notion that there was no innovation unveiled tuesday in @entity209 . " i am not sure how they can talk about a 64 - bit architecture and fingerprinting ... as a lack of innovation , " she said . " it might not be the innovation people are looking for , such as a larger screen , but it 's hard to say ' lack of . ' " the @entity10 will contain the first 64 - bit processor in a smartphone , which promises to increase the performance and speed of data - intensive games and other apps . touch id is a new security feature that will allow users to use their fingerprints to unlock the device . and the phone 's camera will now let you shoot slow - motion video . there may have been no @entity237 or sleek new design . but at the end of the day , @entity194 said , the @entity10 got better . and a better new @entity10 is still a formidable product . " in most cases @entity6 does not walk on others ' paths , " she said . " they create their own and stick to it . this is not necessarily the easy way to do it in the short term , but assures that they remain in control . "

but some say it 's not fair to expect major innovation from @placeholder every year
