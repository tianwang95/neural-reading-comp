( @entity0 ) -- fighting criticism of his controversial remarks on government dependency , @entity1 challenger @entity1 said wednesday that he would better help poor and middle class @entity5 than president @entity7 . @entity1 and running mate rep. @entity8 also sought to reshape the campaign narrative less than seven weeks before the november vote by accusing @entity7 of favoring wealth redistribution -- code for socialism among conservatives -- based on a 1998 video of the president as a state senate candidate in @entity18 . @entity5 does not work by government making people dependent on government , @entity1 told a fundraising event in @entity23 , adding " that will kill the @entity5 entrepreneurship that 's lifted our economy over the years . " " the question of this campaign is not who cares about the poor and the middle class ? i do . he does , " the former @entity34 governor said to rising cheers . " the question is who can help the poor and the middle class ? i can ! he ca n't ! " @entity1 spoke as fellow @entity41 appeared divided over his secretly recorded comments from a may 17 fundraiser that were made public this week . " there are 47 % of the people who will vote for the president no matter what , " @entity1 said in a clip from the event first posted online on monday . " there are 47 % who are with him , who are dependent on government , who believe that , that they are victims , who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them . who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing . " he also said he would " never convince " the 47 % of @entity5 who pay no federal income tax " that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives . " in response , three @entity41 @entity71 candidates in tough races this fall have distanced themselves from @entity1 's comments . sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , told @entity0 on wednesday that he had a " a very different view of the world " than what @entity1 expressed . " as a @entity5 senator , i think i represent everybody , and i think every vote is important , " @entity75 said , adding : " i do n't write off anybody . " a day earlier , @entity41 sen. @entity84 of @entity34 and @entity41 candidate @entity85 of @entity86 released campaign statements denouncing @entity1 's comments . some conservative commentators also criticized @entity1 , questioning whether he understood the conservative principles he championed to win the @entity41 nomination . " these appear to be the words of somebody who does n't understand @entity5 conservatism and its relationship to the @entity5 idea , " wrote journalist @entity91 of the conservative @entity92 . " conservatives do n't believe in economic determinism . conservatives know -- and explain why -- their economic policies will help the poor , as well as senior citizens , working families , and our troops who pay no income taxes . " others on the political right defended @entity1 's comments as an accurate assessment of growing societal dependence on government through entitlement and welfare programs that are major contributors to the mounting federal deficit and debt . " i think the basic point is correct . it 's what this election is about . do we want a government - centered society ? " said @entity41 sen. @entity122 of @entity123 . " do we want to continue to build government and grow our debt at an unsustainable level and bankrupt this nation ? or do we want to start working toward a path of opportunity , success - things that actually make this country great . " ' anatomy of a leak ' of the @entity1 video a flurry of polls this week showed @entity1 unable to make up ground on @entity7 and slipping behind in some key battleground states , including @entity142 . a new @entity0 / @entity144 survey on wednesday showed @entity7 also holding a 52 % -44 % lead in @entity1 's birth state of @entity147 . another new poll showed the secretly recorded @entity1 comments had a moderately negative impact on registered voters so far . the @entity153 survey taken tuesday showed 36 % of registered voters indicated they would be less likely to vote for @entity1 after the videotapes were released , while 20 % said they were more likely to vote for @entity1 and 43 % said the comments made no difference . meanwhile , the @entity159 on tuesday posted a video clip of @entity7 reportedly recorded in 1998 at @entity161 in which he discussed ways to make government more effective . " i think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution - because i actually believe in some redistribution , at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody 's got a shot , " @entity7 says in the clip . both @entity8 and @entity1 made sure to mention the redistribution reference on the campaign trail on wednesday . " president @entity7 said that he believes in redistribution , " @entity8 told supporters in @entity177 , @entity142 . " @entity1 and i are not running to redistribute the wealth . @entity1 and i are running to help @entity5 create wealth . " at the @entity183 , spokesman @entity182 characterized the @entity41 attacks as an effort to divert attention from @entity1 's controversial remarks . @entity7 believed in 1998 and still believes that " there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all @entity5 have a fair shot , if they work hard , " @entity182 said . " he certainly does n't believe -- as some apparently do -- that any student who looks for a government - backed loan is looking for a handout or that a senior citizen receiving @entity203 is a freeloader or a combat veteran not paying taxes is a victim , " @entity182 continued , adding : " when a campaign is having a bad day or a bad week or some might say a bad month ... you sometimes witness an effort that seems desperate to change the subject . " other democrats were quick to pile on . senate majority leader @entity209 of @entity210 said @entity1 's comments showed he only wants to be president of half the country . " we have a long line of people who are running from @entity1 as if the @entity218 are still on , " @entity209 quipped about @entity41 @entity71 candidates @entity75 , @entity84 and @entity215 . @entity7 told the " @entity219 " on tuesday night that " one of the things i learned as president is you represent the entire country . if you want to be president , you have to work for everyone . " the @entity1 remarks , which sparked numerous fact checks , have gained more attention on @entity230 than his speech at last month 's @entity232 . @entity208 pounce on @entity1 comments priorities @entity5 , a pro-obama super pac , is using the @entity1 clips in a new television ad to characterize @entity1 as out of touch with @entity5 ' economic struggles . the group said wednesday the commercial would air in @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity142 and @entity123 , all battlegrounds that @entity7 won in 2008 and hopes to take again in november . on tuesday , @entity8 said at a campaign stop in @entity246 that @entity1 's comments were " obviously inarticulate " but made the correct point that people have become too dependent on government under @entity7 . @entity1 presented the same argument wednesday in a @entity252 op - ed. " under president @entity7 , we have a stagnant economy that fosters government dependency . my policies will create a growing economy that fosters upward mobility , " he wrote . " @entity260 has a role to play here . right now , our nation 's citizens do need help from government . but it is a very different kind of help than what president @entity7 wants to provide . " how candidates are preparing for the debates @entity0 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report .

@entity1 's leaked remarks get more attention on @placeholder than his convention address
