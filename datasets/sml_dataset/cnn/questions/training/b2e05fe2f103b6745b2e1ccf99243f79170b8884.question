( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 social workers were familiar with @entity3 long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in @entity7 , according to documents from the state @entity9 . police also had contact with him the day his children disappeared , when he allegedly admitted to a @entity16 sheriff 's deputy that he " forced " his five kids , all between the ages of 1 and 8 , out of a vehicle at a @entity20 on august 28 , according to an affidavit . @entity3 was transferred thursday from a @entity23 jail to @entity16 , where he was served with arrest warrants in connection with his children 's deaths . @entity3 , who faces five murder counts , was scheduled to have a first - appearance hearing friday morning but waived his right to appear . he is now scheduled for a hearing on november 13 , the judge said . @entity3 , 32 , was arrested saturday in @entity38 , @entity23 , and charged with driving under the influence , possession of synthetic marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia , the @entity33 in @entity2 said . three days later , @entity3 led @entity16 and federal authorities to five sets of remains near @entity43 , @entity7 . police announced this week that @entity3 drove 700 miles with his kids ' bodies wrapped in garbage bags in the back of his suv . @entity3 and the children were listed as missing persons last week after @entity3 failed to drop off the children with his ex-wife . a long @entity9 file according to reports from the state @entity9 , case workers had expressed concerns about the children in the past , as early as 2011 , but the most recurring complaint was that the @entity3 ' house was a mess . the first @entity9 visit came in september 2011 , a report says , when a caseworker visited the home because of allegations that the kids -- at the time , only three -- were dirty and not attending school . the mother , who was pregnant , said that the children were 3 , 4 and 5 and too young to start school , but that when they were of age , they would be home - schooled , the report says . the caseworker expressed concern that the kids were barefoot and that there were tools and construction items lying in the living room , the report says . on a followup inspection , the house was clean , the report says , but the following month , the caseworker visited and spoke to @entity3 on the phone . during the conversation , " he became very hostile " and told the caseworker " she was ruining people 's lives . " the caseworker called police , but when @entity3 arrived , he 'd calmed down , the report states . the caseworker told @entity3 the home was n't safe for the kids , and @entity3 took them to a hotel , it said . in may 2012 , after the couple had separated , the caseworker visited and the mother gave the caseworker documents indicating some domestic abuse issues . the caseworker advised the mother to go to a shelter , but she said " she did not want to do that and she would be okay . " in june of that year , the mother told @entity9 that @entity3 had taken the kids -- now four of them -- to live with his grandparents in @entity23 . the mother , who was pregnant with the couple 's fifth child , went to visit her mother in @entity116 in august 2012 , and @entity9 submitted the case for closure . the case was closed in october 2012 . renewed @entity9 interest four months ago , a @entity2 dss case manager spoke to one of the children , who said @entity3 made them do exercises for punishment . there was a mark on the child 's neck , and the child said @entity3 spanked his kids with a belt . " child did not indicate any verbal fear of father , " the report says . the child 's sister confirmed that they did pushups and other exercises for punishment and that their " father will slam them around playing . " " she stated that is not afraid of her dad , " the report states . @entity9 determined the children should not be removed from the home , and there was n't cause to arrest the father . @entity3 admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son , and the case manager told @entity3 to refrain from physical discipline . ten days later , the case manager arrived on one of the kids ' birthdays . cupcakes were out . @entity3 said his ex-wife had left him for a younger man and she had n't seen her kids in four months , the report says . the case was closed in july , but a case manager was called on august 13 after allegations that @entity3 beat his son , leaving bruising , and that he was not feeding them properly , at times making all five kids split a 20 - piece chicken nugget dinner , the @entity9 report states . once interviewed , the children denied any abuse or neglect and told the case manager what meals they 'd eaten the night before . " @entity177 appears to be overwhelmed as he is unable to maintain the home , but the children appear to be clean , groomed and appropriately dressed , " the report states . of that encounter , @entity180 , a representative of the @entity2 @entity9 , said , " @entity9 did not see any visible signs of abuse . ... at the time , there was nothing to alarm them . " @entity3 and the children disappear the next calls to @entity9 came on september 3 and 4 . the sheriff 's department was seeking @entity3 and the children , whom @entity3 ' ex-wife had reported missing . @entity3 , a computer tech and @entity194 graduate , told neighbors last week that he was moving his children from their home near @entity16 to another state . it 's unclear how or why @entity3 allegedly killed his children , but acting sheriff @entity200 of @entity16 told reporters that @entity3 drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his suv . it is believed he killed all the children at the same time , and that the crime happened in @entity16 , @entity200 said . " i do n't understand why he did it but , yes , these children were in the car , deceased , in garbage bags for some period of time , " @entity200 said . when @entity3 was picked up saturday at a police checkpoint in @entity23 , he seemed " very strange , maybe somewhat disoriented , a little bit on the violent side , " @entity200 said . in the car , police later found " cleaning material . they saw blood . they saw children 's clothing but no children . " the remains found in @entity7 have been returned to @entity2 , where autopsies will be performed . " i 'm a father and i 'm a grandfather , and in all of my years of law enforcement , i have never seen a case like this , " @entity200 said . standing before television cameras with his wife sobbing by his side , @entity3 ' father spoke to reporters wednesday . " we know that the angels are with us , but your prayers are helping us cope , " @entity235 said . " we do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them , but anyone who knows little @entity235 will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media . " he described his son as " a very loving father , brother and son " and said the family was heartbroken . missing nursing student 's remains found in @entity253 @entity255 mother accused of suffocating kids , 1 and 3 @entity0 's @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .
