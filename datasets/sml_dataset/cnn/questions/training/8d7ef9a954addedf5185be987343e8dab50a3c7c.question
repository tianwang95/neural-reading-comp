( @entity0 ) -- some of the world 's most well - known companies like @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , boots and @entity7 have become successful partly by convincing us through their products that their corporate values align with consumers ' personal values . but what happens when these companies behave in ways that seem to betray our trust ? what if you find out that these companies keep their huge profits offshore and out of reach of domestic tax authorities ? will people challenge them -- " you want to change the world and have us pick up the tab ? " yes , people are voicing their discontent . at @entity3 's @entity31 in june , protesters loudly criticized @entity3 for keeping $ 54.4 billion offshore to avoid paying @entity33 corporate taxes . @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 are other high - profile companies have also come under scrutiny and criticism for similar tax avoidance behavior . the fact is that over $ 2 trillion in @entity33 corporate profits is parked offshore . this should infuriate many law - abiding , taxpaying citizens . what 's the justice in this ? former labor secretary @entity50 put it aptly when he said that lost tax revenue " has to be made up by you and me and every other taxpayer who ca n't afford high - flying attorneys and accountants to shift our income into places with low taxes . " of course , the companies do n't see it that way and deserve a hearing . for them , it 's a difficult business dilemma . the @entity33 is alone among developed nations in requiring double taxation for corporations . @entity33 - based companies face a 39 % corporate tax rate -- the highest in the developed world -- and are required to pay tax twice on foreign profits : once to the country in which the revenue was made , and a second time to the @entity33 if and when the money is brought back . corporations say they keep so much profit offshore because they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to maximize profits by any legally allowed means , including avoiding taxes . meanwhile , consumers watch critically as companies play out their tax avoidance strategies -- from protecting foreign profits to actually moving their headquarters to other countries . @entity3 , for example , has an extremely proactive corporate tax avoidance strategy that allowed the company to pay an effective tax rate of 12.6 % -- one of the lowest among @entity33 corporations . seventy percent of @entity3 's profits -- and $ 54.4 billion in earnings -- are allocated overseas through subsidiaries in countries with much lower rates ( like @entity103 and the @entity104 ) and out of the grasp of @entity33 tax authorities . repatriating @entity3 's offshore money would cost the company about $ 18.4 billion and increase its effective tax rate to 33.8 % . @entity36 would have had to pay $ 11.7 billion in additional @entity33 taxes had it brought back $ 43.8 billion in 2013 . other companies choose to move to avoid paying taxes or receive a lower tax rate . @entity37 , which makes medical device technology , plans to move its headquarters to @entity114 after a merger with @entity116 , a non- @entity33 company . @entity37 will then enjoy a corporate tax rate much lower than in the @entity33 the trend among large companies these days to embrace social responsibility and transparency leads people to expect them to behave , well , more responsibly . so it is ironic that some of the biggest companies are shirking taxes on their profits . but people notice . advocacy groups in the @entity129 and @entity33 are targeting tax - avoiding companies by personalizing the impact of lost tax revenue in terms easy for citizens to rally around . the group @entity135 has pointed out that @entity3 's fair share of @entity33 tax on offshore profits in 2011 could have paid salaries for 90,000 teachers . boots ' $ 1.2 billion revenue sheltered from @entity129 taxation could have funded salaries for 85,000 nurses at the @entity146 . as @entity148 and @entity149 showed us in the 1960s , activist voices can galvanize consumers and fuel them with the spirit of populism . people with a tangible target for their general financial dissatisfaction may equate these companies -- and business leaders -- with the glaring inequality of our time . in a recent @entity165 piece , @entity163 's billionaire investor @entity162 warned that @entity33 may one day come after the tech and money plutocracy with pitchforks . history shows that it 's impossible for the very wealthy to predict when consumer unhappiness can boil over into outright upheaval . he predicts that moment is coming . companies that are out of sync with their consumers ' values -- even in their legitimate self - interest -- are at risk of having a center that can not hold over time . that could be detrimental to their business in the long term . in @entity129 , for example , @entity7 saw a 29 % drop in the company reputation score , from +3 to -26 , after a @entity190 report that showed the chain paid no tax on 1.2 billion pounds in sales and claimed to have made no profit in @entity129 after 14 years of operations . that probably was n't the smartest move . companies that try to hide their profits , through whatever loophole , risk testing the goodwill of consumers . more and more , young people care about a company 's values . more than half of the millennials recently surveyed by @entity209 said they would consider leaving an employer if its social responsibility and values no longer matched their own . millennials are important to the growth of any company , as consumers and as prospective employees . companies that spend millions to control their images and public narratives by being in touch with consumers may end up being perceived as out of touch if they keep avoiding paying taxes . consumers may not storm the barricades and topple @entity3 stores , or forgo their morning coffee , but they will crave economic justice , and they will press for changes .

big brands like @placeholder , @entity7 put their profits offshore to lower their tax bills
