( @entity0 ) -- if you believe the talking heads , it sounds like the worst of the worst is over for the " @entity4 . " @entity5 , left , and son @entity6 in 1938 . whether or not that 's true , it does n't mean that everyone is suffering or has suffered . even during our country 's worst economic downturn , some folks still knew how to make a buck -- many bucks , in fact . 1 . @entity17 the @entity17 was never shy about conspicuous consumption . while baseball players ' salaries were nowhere near as high in the ' 30s as they are today ( adjusted for inflation ) , @entity17 was at the top of the heap . while possibly apocryphal , when @entity17 found out that his $ 80,000 ( more than $ 1 million today ) a year salary was $ 5,000 more than that of president @entity27 , he is reported to have said , " well , i had a better year than he did . " 2 . @entity29 while not using methods we 'd endorse , @entity29 and his compatriots managed to compile more than $ 3 million in today 's dollars . robbing dozens of banks and killing police officers in the process , @entity29 is not exactly what we 'd call " successful , " but the brash , charming , and audacious @entity29 became just the type of anti-hero that the bedraggled , unemployed masses loved . he was shot to death in @entity42 by @entity44 agents in 1934 . 3 . @entity45 a man unfamiliar to most , yet whose modern ideas revolutionized @entity49 life , @entity45 changed our retail landscape by creating the modern supermarket . a former executive at @entity53 , @entity45 struck out on his own in 1930 after higher - ups rejected his ideas for more suburban , larger , self - serve food markets with room for automobile parking and allowances for new - fangled home refrigeration . within two years , @entity45 's stores ( known as @entity63 ) were doing more than $ 6 million in revenue ( more than $ 75 million today ) . his motto : " pile it high : sell it cheap . " @entity0 : how the @entity66 gave rise to soap operas 4 . @entity69 the diminutive song - and - dance man turned tough guy turned song - and - dance man rose like a rocket through @entity74 in the 1930s . he went from a $ 500 - a - week contract player in 1930 to one of the top ten moneymakers in @entity74 during 1935 . in 1933 he was making the equivalent of $ 40,000 a week . his rise was so fast that he offered to do a few movies for free just to get out of a five - year contract with @entity83 . 5 . @entity84 finding himself out of work after the crash of ' 29 , @entity84 spent a few years perfecting -- though some would say pilfering -- a little parlor game that eventually came to be known as @entity91 . within a year of registering the patent , @entity92 was selling 20,000 units a year , and @entity84 became the world 's first millionaire game designer . 6 . @entity98 @entity97 an amazing beneficiary of good timing and great business acumen , @entity99 created an oil empire out an inheritance of $ 500,000 received in 1930 . with oil stocks massively depressed , he snatched them up at bargain prices and created an oil conglomerate to rival @entity110 . throughout the 20th century he became a billionaire many times over . @entity0 : the kidnapping of @entity99 's grandson 7 . @entity115 the @entity116 may have been @entity116 , but the @entity117 in the 1930s was @entity115 . from his humble beginnings as a traveling trombone player -- and superb high school football player being named " best left end in @entity123 " -- @entity115 rose to put together his first band in 1937 . the band fell apart . undaunted as any good left end would be , he reorganized a new group in 1938 and quickly found success . with hits like " @entity133 , " " @entity134 , " and " @entity132 , " @entity115 and his band found themselves on radio , in the movies and commanding a salary of nearly $ 20,000 a week . in 1942 , just at the height of his popularity , @entity115 disbanded his group and volunteered for the @entity142 , where he formed a military band to help build morale during the war . he was lost during a flight over the channel from @entity148 to @entity149 in 1944 . the plane was never found . 8 . @entity151 sure , all we remember of @entity151 is the insanely long fingernails , @entity155 box hats , and storing his own urine in mayonnaise jars , but there was a whole crazy stellar career before that . after the ' 29 crash , seemingly unfazed , he made " @entity164 " -- then the most expensive movie ever -- at a cost of $ 3.8 million . in 1932 , at the height of the nation 's economic woes , he formed the @entity169 . he built the company into a major - league defense supplier and by the time he died in 1976 , his fortune totaled a reported $ 2.5 billion . maybe there 's something to that whole urine saving thing . 9 . @entity176 the @entity66 was @entity176 's golden era . rising from a local radio yodeler ( nearly every station had their own yodeler back then ) to a hit machine throughout the decade , @entity176 appeared in over 40 movies , becoming the top western draw at the box office . the singing cowboy , not content to be just a yodeler , albeit a very successful one , later created a tv and radio broadcasting empire in the @entity191 and bought the @entity192 . @entity0 : 7 ridiculous products licensed by @entity194 10 . @entity195 @entity195 , @entity196 , patriarch of the @entity198 clan , built up a tidy sum in the 1920s with a hearty amount of speculation , peppered with insider trading and market manipulation . unlike many other of his ilk who helped to create the unstable markets that brought about the financial calamities of the ' 30s however , @entity5 knew when to get out . out of the stock market , @entity208 invested his money in real estate , liquor , and movie studios , generating gaudy profits and cementing his family 's place in the highest financial echelon of @entity49 society . for more mental_floss articles , visit @entity220 entire contents of this article copyright , @entity222 rights reserved .
