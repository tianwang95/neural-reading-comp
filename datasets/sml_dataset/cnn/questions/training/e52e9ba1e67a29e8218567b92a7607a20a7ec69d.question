@entity1 gastronomy is a male - dominated world , and its centuries - old traditions are fiercely protected . so , although @entity5 is the daughter and granddaughter of @entity8 - starred chefs , it was not always clear she would continue the family tradition . but in 2007 , with no formal training , @entity5 became the only female chef in @entity1 ( and only the fourth woman in history ) to earn the culinary world 's top honor -- a three - @entity8 - star rating -- for her family 's restaurant , @entity19 , in the @entity21 town of @entity22 . while in 2011 , she was voted @entity24 's @entity23 as part of the @entity26 . @entity5 believes her success comes because of , not in spite of , being a woman . she considers the lighthearted taste combinations she has pioneered to be an expression of her femininity : diners at her flagship restaurant can eat turbot flavored with jasmine , veal sweetbreads flavored with lavender and oysters with sorrel jelly and licorice yoghurt . the men in @entity5 's life are also important to her success , though . having left her hometown as a teenager to study management , @entity5 returned to @entity22 , aged 23 , to learn cooking from her father , shortly before he died . now 42 , she has a six - year - old son and works with her husband to run @entity19 , which has expanded to include a boutique hotel , a cooking school and a casual bistro . in 2009 , @entity54 opened another @entity8 - starred restaurant in @entity56 , and launched a gastronomic foundation for children . her first @entity60 restaurant , @entity61 , opens in september . here , @entity5 speaks to @entity62 about the influence of family and femininity on her work . on the glass ceiling ... in the very beginning -- i 'm talking about 20 years ago -- the profession was not open - minded enough to accept a woman in this job , and i felt that very strongly . that can awaken something very strong , though . little by little , i realized that being a woman could be a strength . it 's another way of thinking about cuisine . it 's another way of managing people , also . on femininity ... all my emotions are feminine , so i have this feminine way in my cooking . i think some men are able to make very feminine cuisine , but they are perhaps more focused on technique , less on developing the emotional part . my great grandmother taught my grandfather how to cook , so the family cuisine came from a woman . on travel ... i left to study business in @entity60 because i did n't know what i wanted to do . i spent six months in @entity96 and six months in the @entity97 . it was good experience . i discovered @entity96 cuisine . i discovered @entity101 . i was far from my family and i had a chance to grow . from others , i discovered the beauty of my father 's job . i needed to leave to understand that . on entering the family business ... i decided to return home in ' 92 to learn from my father . i spent three months with him . we talked a lot . it was a beautiful time . unfortunately , that september , he passed away . of course , it was a shock . how to manage without him ? i was in the kitchen but it was difficult because i missed him a lot . i decided to work in reception , but when we lost a [ @entity8 ] star in ' 95 , i decided to return to the kitchen . i felt i had lost my father 's third star , and i had to get it again for him . on success ... the main change was that the phone kept ringing all the time . it was like a tsunami . and even though it 's an honor , when you get the third star you now must give more effort , more energy to maintain standards and even improve the organization . on trust ... if you are fully booked all the time , you need to have more employees and to train them . i was quite afraid of development . because i 'm a perfectionist , i could n't trust a team not working with me everyday . but because i 'm also a mother , i have to trust people . i 'm not in the kitchen all day ; i am sometimes with my son . it can be an adventure to trust people . on being a mother ... i was married , i became a mother , and it changed me a lot . it gave me more maturity in my cuisine , also . i used to say , it 's more important for me to be a mother than to be a chef , because if i do n't feel all is well with my child , i 'm not able to work well . so , it influences my creativity . and it balances my character : i 'm a perfectionist , but when i go home , i can forget all my troubles . on her typical day ... i wake at seven in the morning and get my child ready for school . i go to work at nine , beginning in the kitchen . if i have appointments with suppliers or if i 'm experimenting , i do that very , very early in the morning because that 's the time i feel better . then there is a lunch service , appointments , discussions about cooking with my assistant . three times a week , i try to pick my son up from school . then my husband comes home . we try to dine together , because it 's the only part of the day all of the family is together . on mentoring women ... i 'm very attentive to the women in the kitchen . i 'm always acting like a mother , looking at their face to see if everything is all right , because i know that physically , they can tire before men . mentally , they are strong . on her husband 's role ... i let him manage everything but the cuisine . the only thing is -- and he knows this -- it has to be feminine . when people come here , they have to feel something the moment they enter the house . his work is as important as mine , but he accepts not being in the spotlight and , for me , that 's proof of intelligence . and love , of course . on advice for others ... the main thing is to develop your own talent . sometimes it takes a lot for people to understand what they are on @entity230 for . you have to trust yourself . when i first started , i did n't know how to cook . i was a woman . i lost my teacher -- my father . but there 's always a way to transform negative to positive . you have to believe in yourself . i do n't believe in myself all the time , but something inside me tells me , ' it 's your job . you have to express your sensibility . ' the point is -- and nobody can do it except you -- to find what you are made for .
