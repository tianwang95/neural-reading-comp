( @entity0 ) -- @entity1 is fixing her deep brown eyes on me . she gently takes my hand and leads me across @entity7 's @entity6 's marble floor , to a window whose white blinds are obscuring the greenery of @entity11 beyond . she places her hand reassuringly on my back and whispers : " ten minutes like this . " frankly , if she had asked me to stay there forever , i would have probably agreed . i have been charmed by the self - styled grandmother of performance art. the legendary @entity21 - born @entity20 - based artist is in @entity7 for the biggest show of her career , and she is revealing a small glimpse of it to a room full of enchanted international journalists . entitled 512 hours , the exhibition will see @entity1 in residence at the @entity6 for 64 days , spending eight hours a day with no breaks trying to create art out of nothing . the museum walls have been stripped , and there are some folding chairs and beds which she may or may not use in storage , but essentially , @entity1 is relying purely on an exchange of energy with her audience . " it took me 25 years to gather courage , concentration and knowledge to come to this " the formidable artist says , clad in an almost monastic outfit of black high - neck shirt , long overcoat and dark trousers . " it 's difficult to say what i 'm going to do because i do n't know . what i do know is that in this piece i have to give not 100 , but 120 per cent of myself , because only then i can create energy out of empty space . " if this seems like an audacious proposal , @entity1 has managed to do something similar with aplomb before . for her 2010 retrospective at the @entity64 in @entity20 , over 850,000 people queued day and night just to sit opposite her , many breaking down in tears when finally faced with her . mesmerizing appeal it 's hard to think of another artist who can draw monumental crowds with such an airy concept , but after spending half an hour with @entity1 , you start to see the pull . strikingly beautiful in the flesh and looking two decades younger than her 67 years , she exudes a mesmerizing mix of hypnotic energy , reassuring warmth and sharp wit . even so , what makes people from all walks of life , as seen in @entity20 , wait for hours just to be in her presence ? " connection , " says @entity85 , co-director of the @entity6 , who first invited @entity1 to stage a show after she won the @entity87 at the @entity88 in 1997 . " when we grow older we lose that connection with other people , and @entity92 helps us regain it through her . " in a career spanning over 40 years , @entity1 has constantly challenged the notions of what art should be , using her body as an instrument , and sometimes risking her life in the process . she has lain inside a burning star of sawdust , had a crossbow pointed to her heart , and even allowed the audience to prod and cut her naked body as she lay motionless . " every performance has a concept , and when i set out the rules i stick to them no matter what , " the artist told me over the phone when i interviewed her about the @entity114 , a space she is creating in @entity116 , @entity20 , for development and study of performance art. " even if in the end i do n't survive , i do n't care , " she says . iron willpower this steely resolve could be attributed to her upbringing in @entity125 , as the daughter of two national heroes ordained for bravery . her family valued achievement above all , and household rules were strict : " until i was 29 years old and left home i had a curfew of 10 pm , so all my performances had to be done by that time . " i think i inherited self - control and discipline from my parents , and the idea that your personal life is n't important , but that what you achieve matters , " she explained in her thick @entity143 accent , only slightly softened by the years she has spent abroad . however , her ascetic approach to her craft has not stopped her from being the darling of the celebrity art circuit . she has danced with @entity151 in his music video , counts @entity153 and @entity154 as loyal fans and friends , and was named as one of @entity159 's most influential people of 2014 . these mainstream accolades have led some critics to accuse @entity1 of losing her avant - garde edge , a judgment that does n't seem to faze her : " i stepped out of an art context into a much larger context , but if anything , i have become more radical . at my age i should be having a nice retrospective , go on holidays , but instead , i decided to push myself like never before and create art out of nothing , it 's not easy you know , " she says laughing . it takes less than 10 minutes in her company to see that for @entity1 , art and life are one thing . even the act of breaking up with her lover and collaborator of many years @entity179 was a performance -- they both walked the @entity185 from opposite directions , meeting for one final embrace in the middle . her unconventional lifestyle has left little place for other people in her world , but you get the sense that the way she lives is less of a choice and more of a necessity : " i wake up every day with so many ideas , and the desire to create is as strong as the need to breathe . for me , art is my cause , " the formidable artist tells me . for those who have hoped to snap a selfie with the grand dame at her @entity210 show , bitter disappointment awaits -- @entity1 is asking her audience to leave their gadgets at home : " i do n't want people to blog or tweet it without experiencing it . the now is the only reality we have in our lives , " she says . it seems that at a time when the pace of life threatens to engulf us , @entity1 wants us to slow down and live in the present . read more : @entity227 : the forgotten war photographer you should know read more : the evolution of @entity231 : from wide - eyed teen to songbird supreme read more : if the shoe fits ... @entity235 teams up with @entity237 ceo
