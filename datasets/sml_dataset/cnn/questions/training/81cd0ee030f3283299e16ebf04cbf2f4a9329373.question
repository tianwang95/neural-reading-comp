the @entity3 police officer who shot @entity4 did n't stop him because he was suspected in a convenience - store robbery , but because he was " walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic , " the city 's police chief said friday . @entity3 police chief @entity9 -- hours after documents came out labeling the 18 - year - old @entity4 as the " primary suspect " in the store theft -- told reporters the " robbery does not relate to the initial contact between the officer and @entity4 . " so why did @entity3 police opt to release surveillance video of the convenience - store incident friday -- the same day they named , six days after the shooting , the white police officer who fatally shot the @entity24 - @entity23 teenager -- if the two situations are n't related ? @entity9 said he distributed the store videotape " because the press asked for it , " noting he could n't withhold it indefinitely . the chief added " we needed to release that at the same time we needed to release the name of the officer involved in the shooting , " though he did n't elaborate on why . identifying the officer was one key demand of demonstrators , along with pressing for other details on the shooting amid allegations of a police coverup . the flurry of details friday added intrigue and , in some ways , anger to a case that 's spurred protests in the @entity51 suburb and beyond among those upset by @entity4 's shooting and what they decry as a heavy - handed police response afterward . @entity4 's family was n't told ahead of time anything about the robbery or store surveillance video , family lawyer @entity56 told @entity62 's @entity61 . regardless , whatever happened there does n't matter , said @entity64 , a cousin of @entity4 's mother . " it 's a diversion , and it 's an attempt to smear @entity4 's character , " said @entity64 , who added the family has " not been happy " with the @entity3 police department 's handling of the case . " ... it ( should be ) more about what happened on @entity74 , where @entity4 was executed . " the man heading security in @entity3 amid the unrest -- @entity79 capt. @entity78 -- stated the robbery and shooting of @entity4 " are separate issues . " " i told ( chief @entity9 ) i think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go , " he told @entity62 on friday evening . " today is about taking care of this incident here , getting to those facts that are there , and @entity4 and his family . " hours earlier , in video captured by @entity62 affiliate @entity94 , @entity78 emphasized authorities have an obligation to be upfront , not to say " some things and now everybody says , ' what does that mean ? ' " " i think if we 're going to give answers , we need to not give hints , " @entity78 said . " we need to say it . " 5 things to know about @entity4 's shooting chief : police officer involved in shooting ' a gentleman ' police identified the officer who shot @entity4 as 28 - year - old @entity111 -- a six - year police veteran , including four years with the @entity3 force . authorities had refused to name him , citing threats to his safety . the fact they have now done so satisfies a major demand of protesters . but many remain perturbed that additional details have not come out about @entity4 's shooting . what the police chief did do on friday was express " every confidence " in @entity111 , who had one side of his face swollen in his encounter with @entity4 , according to authorities . " he ( is ) a gentleman ... a quiet officer , " @entity9 said . the entire situation is " devastating , it 's absolutely devastating " to @entity111 . much more information was provided about the reported convenience store robbery . that includes the surveillance video , which shows a large @entity24 - @entity23 man pushing aside a smaller man who seemingly tries to stop him , then leaving the store . @entity56 said the larger man " appears to be " @entity4 . newly released police documents claim the teenager roughly handled a clerk trying to stop him before walking out of the store with the box of @entity147 . read the police documents the cost for the box of cigars , according to the documents : $ 48.99 . @entity9 , the @entity3 police chief , told @entity62 that @entity111 confronted @entity4 for being in the road , not the robbery . " i guess that is when he might have seen ... evidence and connected it " to the robbery , @entity9 said -- without explicitly tying the two incidents together himself . relative : actions ' fueled the distrust ' toward police a key complaint of protesters has been -- while police have said the shooting occurred during a struggle for the officer 's gun -- witnesses say the officer shot @entity4 as the teenager stood with his hands in the air . @entity174 , who saw what happened , told @entity62 that " it looked as if @entity4 was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in . " instead , a shot went off , the teen broke free , and the officer got out of the vehicle and ran about 20 feet in pursuit , she and co-worker @entity178 said . another man , @entity184 , said he was with @entity4 at the time of the shooting and that police shot @entity4 without provocation . " we was n't committing any crime , bringing no harm to nobody , but my friend was murdered in cold blood , " he told @entity62 affiliate @entity189 . @entity9 confirmed to reporters friday that @entity78 , at least , " did not commit a crime and was not complicit in a crime . " the information released friday seems unlikely to quell the anger in the eastern @entity201 city or elsewhere . @entity64 , speaking for @entity4 's family , expects the opposite will be the case -- even as he stressed that any protests must remain peaceful . " this ( police ) chief ... is just inciting the crowd and making everybody angry , " @entity64 said . " it just fueled the distrust that was already out there for the @entity3 police department . " yet there were also some who said the robbery is not necessarily irrelevant to what happened next . " a robbery does n't justify shooting @entity222 , but it definitely changes your perspective on his mindset at the time of police encounter , " read one @entity219 post from @ @entity220 . complete coverage of the @entity3 shooting ' police chiefs are watching ' the full , complicated story has stirred an intense , nationwide discussion on race in the @entity23 , and on the shooting itself as well as the response to demonstrators afterward . accusers accused some protesters of violence and looting , while many on the other side have ripped what they call an over-the - top , militarized police response . so what 's next ? there 's still the possibility that action -- including , potentially , criminal charges -- could be taken against officer @entity111 . then there 's the potential for political fall - out affecting @entity201 gov. @entity255 or @entity3 's police chief . and there 's still a lot of anger about the shooting and the ensuing police response , and there are many angry people on the streets . a major rally is set for sunday to demand action by authorities . " this situation has been handled very badly , " civil rights leader @entity268 said friday from @entity3 . " people here must turn their pain into power . " undeterred by rain , people still made their voices heard friday night on the streets of @entity3 -- some raising their hands up high , like they say @entity4 did before being shot dead by @entity279 . " it 's tragic what happened , but we 're all united and working together , " said @entity280 . " it 's not a race thing , it 's a right - or - wrong thing . " the scene -- which mixed in chants and sign - holders with live music -- was a stark contrast to earlier in the week . police used tear gas , rubber bullets and armored equipment , and accused some protesters of throwing rocks and @entity298 cocktails . one demonstrator , @entity299 , noted the peaceful and communal nature of friday 's gatherings , saying , " we 're having a good time in the name of @entity4 . " it 's seemingly no coincidence that things calmed calmed significantly thursday , which was the day the state highway patrol took over security . rather than confront protesters , @entity78 figuratively and literally has embraced them . talking later to @entity62 , the highway patrol captain said he thinks this whole ordeal -- as it relates to race relations between communities and law enforcement , as well as how authorities respond to protests -- " will create change throughout our nation . " for example , he expects there will be talk about diversity training and tactics . " this is all over the world , and i think police chiefs are watching -- deciding what they need to do and what they need to do better , " he said . opinion : how many unarmed people have to die ?
