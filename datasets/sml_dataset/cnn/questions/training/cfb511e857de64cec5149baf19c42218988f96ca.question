@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the head of the railway whose runaway train devastated a small @entity1 town cast doubt on his engineer 's story wednesday as he arrived to face insults from survivors and harsh questions from reporters . @entity14 said the engineer has been suspended without pay and faces a criminal investigation by @entity19 authorities . he said the engineer reported to railroad managers that he set 11 hand brakes on the train cars before they broke away from their engines , but " i think it 's questionable whether he did . " " our general feeling is now that is not true , " said @entity14 , chairman of the @entity27 . the engineer had worked for the @entity27 for " many years " and " had a completely clear safety record up until saturday , " @entity14 said . most of the 73 - car train derailed in the center of @entity0 early saturday , and tank cars full of oil exploded and burned . @entity1 provincial authorities have found 20 bodies , and 30 more are missing " and most probably dead , " @entity41 capt. @entity40 said wednesday . graphic : runaway train devastates @entity19 town authorities have said those still missing may have been vaporized by the resulting inferno . the number of those unaccounted for dropped from the 45 reported earlier wednesday , and @entity40 said the numbers could fluctuate as the investigation continues . the railway cars strewn throughout the center of the town 6,000 have barely stopped smoldering , and the area around them remained cordoned off wednesday afternoon . hundreds of evacuees , mostly older residents , were still taking shelter in a local school , said @entity60 , a spokeswoman for the @entity19 @entity61 . in the beginning , there were 2,000 people who were forced to flee their homes , @entity60 said " everyone here knows someone who was evacuated , " she said . nevertheless , she added , " you see a lot of solidarity and resilience . " a fair bit of anger was also on display as @entity14 arrived wednesday afternoon . two middle - aged men shouted at him as he spoke with reporters , calling him an obscene name and challenging him to walk into the heart of the disaster . one of the men , @entity82 , told @entity2 he knew at least half the people who were dead or missing . " they should put that guy in prison , " @entity82 said . " he 's a murderer ... he should be in prison . " @entity14 also was likely to face a chilly reception from mayor @entity89 . @entity14 said he was trying to arrange meetings with the mayor , who would not tell reporters wednesday whether she would meet with him . @entity14 said he felt " personally , absolutely rotten " about the crash and said his railroad would " stand up to our responsibility . " as chairman , " i guess it 's my role to collect all this criticism , " he said . " we think we have plenty of responsibility , " he said . but whether the company bears " total responsibility " for the crash is " yet to be determined , " he added . the cars broke free from an @entity27 train as it was parked in the nearby town of @entity110 early saturday , plunging down a seven - mile incline into @entity0 . firefighters in @entity110 had been called to put out a fire on the train before the cars broke away , and @entity14 said those firefighters may have shut down systems on the train 's five locomotives that contributed to the disaster . " we felt this probably had an important part to play in this tragedy , " he said . the fire department in @entity110 has rejected the notion . the engineer had parked the train and set hand brakes on all five engines and then checked into a hotel for the night . firefighters reported the blaze to a track maintenance man , who alerted the company to the incident , @entity14 said . the engines and nine other cars remained behind when the rest of the train broke away sometime later . they stopped a quarter of a mile away from their original parking spot in @entity110 . police : evidence criminal act may have led to train crash investigators have asked fire crews to stop spraying down the wreckage to preserve as much of the remaining evidence as possible . @entity1 police spokesman @entity148 said wednesday , " we are no longer treating this as just an accident . " some of the evidence led investigators to believe a " criminal act " may have contributed to the train crash , @entity40 said tuesday . but @entity40 said authorities would lay no blame until the investigation shows exactly what happened . all businesses and factories in the affected region that are able were reopening wednesday morning , @entity158 said . she said the @entity61 would begin distributing vouchers to those returning home for food and other essential items , with the funds for the vouchers donated by people in the community and businesses in the region . the mayor urged tourists not to cancel their reservations in the area , noting that some 300,000 people visit the region between may and october every year . and she thanked people from around the world who sent messages in the aftermath of the tragedy . " all these messages give us the strength to face this catastrophe , " she said . quebec premier @entity190 said the provincial government would provide $ 25 million in emergency assistance immediately , with another $ 25 million to help with reconstruction efforts . " it 's small comfort , we know , " @entity190 said . but she said the government hopes rebuilding will become " a mobilizing force " for the town . tuesday , some 1,200 residents were allowed to return to their homes in the area . among them was @entity203 , who was eating lunch wednesday on his patio , a few blocks from the edge of the cordon . @entity203 said @entity0 's downtown had lost everything , but within a few years , " everything will be back up . " @entity2 's @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .
