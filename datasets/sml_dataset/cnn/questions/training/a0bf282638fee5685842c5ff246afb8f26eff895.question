editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of history and public affairs at @entity6 's @entity5 . his new book , " @entity8 : the @entity9 -- from @entity11 to the @entity12 , " will be published this fall by @entity10 . @entity2 writes widely on current events . @entity2 says so far the @entity15 presidency resembles that of @entity17 . @entity18 , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- while pundits have compared president @entity15 to @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , less attention has been paid to another , perhaps more apt parallel -- @entity17 . sometimes the similarities are striking . both aimed high , seeking major legislation to reshape @entity31 -- @entity17 with civil rights and @entity33 , @entity15 with health care and energy legislation . both @entity17 and @entity15 understood that @entity36 was a credit - claiming institution whose members did not like to have proposals rammed down their throats . @entity17 's style of political leadership was famous . a creature of the @entity43 , @entity17 loved to lean on legislators and intimidate them into supporting his agenda . as @entity43 majority leader from 1955 to 1961 , @entity17 had been famous for subjecting colleagues to the " treatment " whereby the hulking @entity49 cornered a legislator in the hallway , stood eye to eye and made his arguments about a bill until he received assurances of support for particular legislation . although @entity17 slightly changed his posture once he was president , he still relied on this kind of interaction to build support . as president from november 1963 until january 1969 , @entity17 worked closely with the @entity64 committee chairmen and ranking republicans who dominated the @entity66 and @entity43 . @entity17 sought to achieve a delicate mix of maintaining control over deliberations -- thinking of ways to obtain what he wanted without giving the appearance of it being a presidential - led idea -- all while responding to the concerns of the chairmen . the back - and - forth deliberations with @entity80 chairman @entity79 over the creation of @entity33 in 1965 have become the classic example of how a president can work the chamber while allowing a congressional leader into the room to shape a bill in ways with which he 'll be comfortable . @entity17 agreed to redesign the particulars of the legislation so that the final program would protect the fiscal integrity of @entity94 ( under which it was included ) and contain long - run costs . thus far , @entity15 has taken a similar approach with the economic stimulus and , more recently , with his budget proposal . the president outlined to @entity36 the basic ideas he wanted in the final product but then left to lawmakers the work of designing the details . while the downside has been that @entity15 relinquished control over the structure of the legislation , @entity66 and @entity43 @entity106 have felt invested and empowered to produce what @entity15 's team viewed as successful results . the second similarity is that @entity17 , like @entity15 , distanced himself from the arguments of liberals who said that conservatives did not need to be feared . @entity17 was consumed by his fears of a right - wing resurgence , even after trouncing @entity121 @entity120 in the 1964 election . @entity17 constantly warned advisers that the most dangerous political force in the country as far as he was concerned was not the left on college campuses but what he called the " reactionary element " within the @entity121 , and he took this into consideration when shaping legislative proposals . with domestic policy , @entity17 avoided programs that could be tagged as " socialistic , " and on foreign policy he worked hard to demonstrate a tough stance against communism . recently released telephone conversations have revealed that @entity17 was obsessed with the 1966 midterm elections after the 1964 election was over , realizing that historically those results were not likely to be good for the @entity66 . @entity15 has been reluctant to embrace liberal arguments about an end to the @entity144 , courting conservative journalists such as @entity146 instead of liberal pundits such as @entity148 . he accepted compromises on legislation in response to moderates in both parties and agreed to a financial bailout that pleased @entity155 , not @entity156 . and his administration has steered clear of explicitly nationalizing banks , a step that could be called socialist . @entity15 has even touched on sensitive subjects such as deficit reduction and @entity94 reform , which are much more appealing to the right than left . during one important conversation , @entity15 told the centrist @entity106 sen. @entity165 of @entity166 that he need not worry about his administration going too far on spending since he identified himself as a new @entity168 , a reference to members of the party who in the @entity172 years believed that they needed to accept some of the arguments of the conservative movement . finally , both presidents understood the strategic importance of leveraging social movements to their political advantage . during the height of the struggles over civil rights , @entity17 frequently pointed to the growing power of the grass - roots civil rights movement as he tried to pressure undecided legislators to support legislation to end public segregation and then to ensure voting rights for african - americans . @entity17 made it clear that the movement had become a potent force in @entity31 life , winning the hearts and minds of citizens , and that it could cause political trouble for his opponents . @entity15 has shown glimmers of a similar strategy with regard to the budget . the administration recently announced that it was trying to mobilize the " net roots " operation from the 2008 campaign to build pressure on wavering representatives and senators to support his plans on health care and the environment . the comparisons between @entity17 and @entity15 likewise offer reminders about what could go wrong for the current president . after all , @entity17 was a politician who looked like a transformative president in 1965 but within three years found himself to be a defeated man who withdrew from the @entity106 primaries . @entity17 's fears of the right , moreover , pushed him and @entity31 deeper into the deadly war in @entity223 . the social movements that @entity17 used to his benefit in 1964 and 1965 turned against him as the administration plunged deeper into @entity223 , a lesson worth thinking about for the current administration . @entity17 's policy of respect for committee chairmen prompted him to make compromises over social policy -- such as cuts in social spending in 1968 -- that weakened his support among the very @entity106 he needed to win re-election . @entity17 was never fully aware of how his greatest political skills could also become the source of his downfall . @entity15 's challenge is to harness the best parts of this comparison -- such as how @entity17 handled @entity36 to produce dramatic legislative results -- without repeating the destructive characteristics that shattered @entity17 's @entity66 . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .
