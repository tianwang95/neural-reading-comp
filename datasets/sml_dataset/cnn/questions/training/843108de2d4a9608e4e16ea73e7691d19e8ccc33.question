( @entity0 ) -- no longer is the promised land of @entity3 's @entity2 reserved for technical wizards . @entity7 's month - old @entity6 app , powered by @entity8 , has been downloaded a few thousand times . just as everyone can publish their own blog on the @entity13 , now developers are making it possible for everyone to make their own applications for @entity6 . both emerging start - ups and veteran developers for mobile platforms are making uploading and updating content on a mobile device accessible with dedicated content management systems ( @entity25 ) and service - based subscriptions . @entity8 is one start - up solution that allows clients to stream music , link to @entity30 and @entity31 , post news and photos and integrate their other social profiles such @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 into one handy interface . " @entity8 was created because we felt that the current solution of paying $ 20,000 for an @entity6 app is only viable for the top 0.001 percent of all musicians , and yet an @entity6 app is a great way to promote and sell music and shows and to give the band a greater connection with their fans , " says @entity39 , ceo of @entity8 developers and designers @entity42 . the @entity8 package includes creation of the application itself , submission to the @entity2 , a @entity13 - based @entity25 , hosting of content , bandwidth and the first 1,000 downloads ( subsequent downloads costs 1 cent each per month ) . if the client decides to charge for the app , @entity8 takes 10 percent of the price , while @entity3 takes a standard 30 percent . and while there are several other players on the mobile market , the undisputed favorite among mobile operating systems -- for now , at least -- is indeed the much - touted @entity6 os. " the @entity6 platform has proven to be a great opportunity for mobile developers , bringing a well - regulated market along with a solid development platform and , most importantly , very well - designed terminals , " says @entity72 , cto of @entity6 developers 8080 . print on demand the @entity83 company 8080 has been making mobile software since 2001 and focuses exclusively on creating @entity6 - based apps and services for publishing , music and advertising . 8080 's nostalgia for traditional fine print design is explicit in its existing iphone apps : @entity93 simulates a newsstand displaying @entity96 files of newspaper front pages that link to their web sites and / or rss feeds ; @entity101 simulates an old - fashioned mechanical typewriter , complete with sound effects . so rather than create an application optimized for mobile devices with flowing text , 8080 's @entity107 encourages clients to upload pre-formatted pdf files to a @entity25 that converts their content into individual page sections , which can be magnified via the @entity6 's touch screen . " our main goals are to preserve the richness of content and graphical style of the printed newspapers , still loved by readers worldwide , while taking advantage of @entity3 's platform for presenting and delivering the content in a pleasant way , " says @entity72 . perhaps more relevant to today 's printed - press financial conundrum are the growing number of ( mostly free ) mobile news applications that run parallel to a news organization 's web site . the best of these optimize mobile browsing of headlines and thumbnails , reading articles , listening to audio , viewing photos and videos , while searching , saving and sharing content . @entity139 also cache the essentials for free off - line consumption and enjoyment , thus reviving the pleasure of reading , watching or listening to media on a traditionally unwired , portable support ( like a book , magazine or newspaper ) . @entity150 lets news organizations create their own @entity6 applications to do just that , not only adapting content to the mobile screen but also downloading and updating when online in a single elegant sweep . " we try to make the @entity159 apps fully functional while you are n't connected and while updating , " says one of the @entity159 developers , @entity157 . " nearly half of the @entity164 devices in the world are the @entity166 . these devices only have support for @entity169 , and wireless is sometimes unavailable when you might want to read the news . it 's very important to provide a good experience in these cases . " @entity150 is based on the idea that information should flow seamlessly through a wide range of media , where mobile is emerging as a primary platform . for this reason , @entity159 apps also support @entity185 data , which allows content - providers to feed the same information into several different applications across platforms . @entity190 challenges to @entity3 but how long will the @entity164 's crown remain unchallenged ? while heavily branded devices such as the @entity195 and @entity196 e-readers reach out to the mobile news market with large flat screens and e-ink , other mobile brands are carefully strategizing their own shares . @entity159 developer @entity201 believes that @entity203 's open - source android platform may take a few years to be delivered on enough handsets to go truly mainstream , but " no other mobile platform is standing still . " " there 's much anticipation about @entity208 . @entity209 is still extremely popular in certain markets . and @entity211 will not allow @entity212 to lose market share without a fight . i think we 're at the beginning of trends which will reshape the mobile market significantly in the next couple of years , " he says . on the television and video end of the media content spectrum , @entity221 has developed technology that allows clients to use a @entity25 to upload and stream live tv and radio , as well as on - demand videos , directly to a number of mobile platforms . " @entity221 is already available for @entity212 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity235 consoles . @entity238 is being developed , " assures @entity221 's vice-president of marketing @entity237 . two of @entity221 's current apps stream uninterrupted , high - quality live @entity242 television programming or @entity243 direct to an @entity6 or @entity166 , effectively bridging the last remaining gaps between traditional and emerging media platforms . and if one of the biggest challenges to news organizations is devising a viable business model for online content , all of the above - mentioned iphone - app solutions also offer optional advertising services , as well as statistical usage reports , to further capitalize on their mobile presence . " we are developing a new ecosystem , where people are consuming more mobile content on bigger screens , in good quality and with a predictable business model , " says @entity237 .
