" eight years of frustration " over the @entity5 war and other military decisions inspired @entity9 artist @entity8 to create painstakingly detailed and unmistakably symbolic artwork from toy soldiers . one piece shows a map of the @entity1 with an inset globe made from the tiny fighters , while another depicts a bush constructed from the soldiers . ireport.com : see @entity8 's toy soldier art some @entity78 say they still support @entity14 , while others said they voted for him but changed their minds about him later . @entity81 is a @entity47 who describes herself as a @entity14 supporter . the @entity85 , @entity86 , resident says the september 11 attacks profoundly changed the way people perceived @entity14 . she says many people were too unwilling to give him a chance . ireport.com : in defense of @entity14 " he is a funny man , a kind man , a bit of a goofball and not very well - spoken , " @entity81 said . " but , he would not have been treated the way he is being treated now if not for 9/11 . his presidency was thwarted by the ' evildoers . ' i love that term of his . " @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103 , hopes history will remember @entity14 as a strong man who loved his country . @entity107 said the president juggled unprecedented challenges during his term , including dealing with terrorism and facing up to financial forces that may not have been under his control . critics of @entity14 should look within themselves for answers , he said . ireport.com : working overtime " most of us are spoiled by a have - it - our - way - now and reckless generation that must stop borrowing so much and start working more . we shift blame instead of looking to ourselves for resolve and drive . " @entity101 said he feels @entity14 is one of the most overworked presidents in history and has shouldered too much blame for the current state of the economy . " i personally have never seen this much responsibility thrown onto our country , in such a small amount of time , " @entity101 said . " we are responsible for the world economy , the global war on terror , global warming . you name it , we have our hands in it . " @entity139 of @entity140 , @entity9 , says september 11 was a defining moment , not just for @entity14 's presidency , but also in his own life . he was in high school and college during @entity14 's eight years in the @entity146 . ireport.com : look back on how @entity14 changed the country he can scarcely remember the @entity14 presidency before 9/11 and expects phrases such as " weapons of mass destruction , " " @entity153 " and " you 're either with us or against us " to be associated permanently with him . he hopes for a brighter future with president - elect @entity52 . " history will likely be kinder to @entity14 than his contemporaries are , but a @entity158 , @entity159 or @entity160 he will not become , " @entity139 said . " what is interesting to note is that some of the worst presidents in history have been followed by the best presidents . perhaps we will have a bright future to look forward to . " @entity169 of @entity170 , @entity171 , voted twice for @entity14 but now regrets her decision . her dislike for the @entity176 candidates ' running mates in 2000 and 2004 was a major factor , she said . ireport.com : watch @entity179 discuss the pros and cons of the president 's time although she wants @entity14 to get out of the national spotlight , she feels he needs to speak to the people and mend wounds . she hopes he will follow sen. @entity189 's example and make a gracious speech after the inauguration . " speak to the @entity1 people passionately and gracefully about @entity52 taking the presidency , " @entity179 said . " that would probably help people . " his presidency was n't all bad , she said . " well , he was good for 9/11 , and he caught @entity200 [ @entity201 ] , but he ran the country into the ground with unneeded funding for an unneeded war in @entity5 , " she wrote . overall , @entity179 has mixed feelings now and has felt uneasy for a long time . she was laid off from her job and is trying to run a home @entity209 business that barely pays rent . she is having trouble finding jobs that pay more than $ 7 per hour . her brother , who has a house payment and a child to support , was recently laid off , as well . she hopes the country can rebuild . " it 's hell , it 's absolutely hell , " she said . " i really hope @entity52 can fix the economy so we can have our lives again and live the @entity1 dream . " the desire to dream again was a common theme , and many @entity78 said they yearn for more hopeful times . @entity226 of @entity227 , @entity86 , said @entity14 's greatest legacy is the passionate voter turnout he unintentionally inspired in the 2008 election . she said she is glad to see @entity52 's rise as a result . ireport.com : one last thing before he goes " i think the one thing president @entity14 will be remembered for is not being able to really connect with people . if you compared him to @entity52 , i tell you , what a difference there is . " @entity242 of @entity243 , @entity244 , said he felt there was a large disconnect between @entity14 and the @entity1 people . he says the president ignored what ordinary folks wanted . " i am afraid that @entity14 will be judged harshly by history , " @entity242 said . " i am also afraid that judgment will be deserved . " but critics should be careful about taking aim at @entity14 , warns @entity255 of @entity256 , @entity86 . " i do not think we should be blaming him for the misery of the last eight years . he is not to blame . we are . you are , the @entity1 people . we voted him into office . " ireport.com : the @entity14 paradox @entity255 says he voted for @entity14 in 2000 , but not in 2004 , adding that he feels @entity14 is responsible for day - to - day decisions that placed the country in a state he finds unfortunate . he watched the final presidential news conference and said he thinks @entity14 should have better addressed the hardships faced by residents who were affected by @entity6 . " i learned my lesson in four years , " @entity255 says . @entity271 of @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , said he believes @entity14 had good intentions . " i think he meant well , " @entity271 said . " i wholeheartedly believe it . in his convictions , he always thought he was doing the right thing . the people elected him . there must have been something people liked . " ireport.com : quotes and commentary @entity271 said he thinks @entity14 should take time out to help the veterans of the war he helped create . overall , he said , the meaning of the @entity14 presidency will be defined by those who pick up where he left off . " the movement of change ? that 's @entity14 's legacy . "
