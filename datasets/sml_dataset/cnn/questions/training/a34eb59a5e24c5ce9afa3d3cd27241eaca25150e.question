editor 's note : this article contains profanity that some may find offensive . this is part one of a three part series showing different aspects of life inside @entity10 's drug gangs . a gang member sniffs in a cloud of cocaine dust as he cuts the drug with other substances . @entity16 , @entity10 ( @entity17 ) -- a young man with tattoos covering one arm rolls hundreds of marijuana joints in the half - light of a shack , perched on a hillside in a @entity26 slum . a 9mm pistol and a .38 revolver lie on his work bench . an old battery - powered radio blares out the salsa music classic , " @entity32 " or " everything comes to an end . " " i 'm getting calluses on my tongue rolling all these spliffs , " he laughs , telling me has enough marijuana for about 1,000 joints . he and his comrades plan to sell them for about 50 cents apiece . a few doors away , two other gang members have raided their mother 's kitchen for soup plates , drinking glasses and a blender . they 've just taken delivery of a kilogram ( 2.2 pound ) brick of pure cocaine . their job now is to cut it and package it in gram bags to peddle on street corners they control . watch as cocaine is cut » a female gang member shows up with two more bags , one containing powdered caffeine and the other lidocaine , a dental anesthetic used to dilute the pure cocaine . they mix business with pleasure . every now and again one of the gang members pulls off the top of the blender and breathes in a cloud of pulverized cocaine . one of them coughs and keels over in the kitchen . seconds later , he 's back on his feet snorting cocaine off a spoon . " breathing that cocaine cloud mellows me out so i need a line to take me back up , " he says . standing in the background , snorting lines of pure cocaine off a pocketknife is the gang leader , a man in his mid- 20s . his cohorts call him " chief . " he tells me they 'll sell the heavily cut cocaine for $ 1.50 a gram . higher purity powder goes for about $ 4 a gram . that 's much cheaper than the $ 50 or $ 60 a heavily cut gram costs on most @entity100 and @entity101 streets , according to estimates from the @entity103 . i agree to conceal @entity92 's true identity to protect him from the police and rival gangs . as we chat , he dismantles a small caliber pistol . watch the gangs in action » " around here the only law is the rules of the street , " he explains . " the rules do n't change ; they always will be the rules , here or anywhere else . " a trusted source , who made the introduction for me , tells me chief is a " total animal living on borrowed time , " who has earned so many enemies he can not risk stepping outside the few hundred square yards of his home turf . " i 'm only human , of course i get afraid , " he says . " afraid my life will end suddenly before i can do anything to get out of this war . " since the time when undisputed cocaine king @entity134 held sway here , the " northeastern commune " district has forged a fearsome reputation as a recruiting ground for drug cartel hit men and violent gang wars . @entity26 is once again in the grip of a vicious drug war . in january to september this year , city authorities say the murder rate has more than doubled with almost 2,000 killings . officials at the @entity26 public prosecutor 's offices say the vast majority of victims were shot , likely victims of rival drug gangs and cocaine capos . watch marijuana joints being rolled by the hundreds » that makes @entity26 as dangerous as @entity157 , the frontier town dubbed @entity159 's most dangerous city as a result of the ongoing cartel war there . authorities in @entity157 say killings are up from last year and are hitting record highs . @entity10 authorities estimate there are around 130 street gangs -- known as " combos " -- in @entity26 , totaling some 6,000 members . their only real loyalty is to the money that drug capos dole out to hire a gang 's services . capos will supply them with drugs to retail on street corners and occasionally issue them weapons to take on rival gangs loyal to another crime boss . until earlier this year , @entity26 's drug underworld was ruled by the so - called " @entity185 , " named after a district of the @entity26 metropolitan area . the " office " was a syndicate of the top cocaine bosses who agreed on the basic rules of doing business in the area . they shared smuggling routes and acted as the ultimate enforcers if cartel members reneged on deals or debts . but the " office " has been ripped apart by infighting . some senior members were arrested , some of those already in jail were extradited and others cut cooperation deals with @entity100 authorities . that left the lower ranks fighting to fill the power vacuum . it 's an internal battle that is still raging . watch how @entity17 's @entity212 got unprecedented access to the gangs » " the ones fueling this war are the ones from the other side . they 've f * * * ed up @entity26 , " chief says . " they 're from @entity26 but they 're traitors . " " they want to get control of all @entity26 so they 're shooting up one gang then another . they 're getting paid to fight . these are wars between the big capos and we 're paying the price out here on the streets , " he adds . chief and his allies have stopped rivals intruding on their turf by strictly enforcing what they call " street rules . " a day before our meeting , @entity92 says he helped bury one of his friends who had been gunned down when he ventured into the heart of @entity26 with a girlfriend . " i could n't even bear to take a look inside the coffin , " he began explaining . " we do n't really know who did it . but it was that crack head girlfriend who persuaded him to go down there . so we killed the bitch . " you see that 's street rules . you have to answer for our friend and the only way you can do that is pay with your life , " he says . chief shies away from questions about which cartel boss is bankrolling his gang . but clearly somebody has been supplying them with guns . they pose with a @entity273 - made .22 - caliber rifle and an assortment of semi-automatic pistols -- as well as the wholesale supply of drugs they then sell on the streets . my conversation with chief is interrupted when another gang member arrives at the improvised drug den. he mumbles to his boss that a local man has been beating up his wife . chief authorizes his underling to go and thrash the accused man with a pool cue . " i do n't think we need cameras for this one please , " he requests . as i get ready to leave i have one last question for chief : i want to know if he ever had any dreams . " i 've tried to get out of this but it 's never quite worked out , " he says . " i 'd like to sail away in a sailboat . alone and far away . "
