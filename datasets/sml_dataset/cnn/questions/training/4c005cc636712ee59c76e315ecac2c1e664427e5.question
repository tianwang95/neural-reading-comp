a private meeting on @entity1 with @entity3 @entity2 and @entity3 officials on wednesday became heated when rank - and - file members expressed frustration about continued @entity8 problems , according to multiple sources in the room . one congressional @entity11 who attended the meeting said senior @entity14 administration officials @entity15 and @entity16 really " got hit " by @entity2 about everything from the troubled website to the broken presidential promise that people can keep the insurance plans they like . the most pressing political challenge for @entity3 @entity2 will come this friday when they will have to vote on a @entity3 @entity25 plan by rep. @entity26 of @entity27 that allows people to keep their policies if they want to . insurance companies have begun canceling certain individual plans mainly due to @entity8 , creating an unexpected hardship for many who could soon find themselves without coverage or wind up facing higher costs for new plans they may not want . in @entity41 alone , more than 1 million people have received policy termination notices from several insurers because their plans do not meet minimum requirements under the @entity8 , the state 's insurance commissioner said this week . insurers have , in a large number of cases , temporarily extended the time frame for ending those agreements . several lawmakers -- even liberals who adamantly support @entity8 -- stood and warned the officials that the @entity3 must come up with a solution before the vote . as @entity55 first reported on tuesday , many @entity3 @entity2 are feeling so much pressure from constituents on this issue that they may feel compelled to vote yes for political reasons . " members want to keep their promises to their constituents , which is that they would have affordable insurance -- if they want to keep the plan they have -- they would keep it , " said rep. @entity61 , @entity62 . " we would offer broader insurance alternatives so that people would have more competitive pricing . " @entity75 congressional sources have told @entity55 that friday is a de facto deadline for the administration to come up with a fix . the preference would be an administrative remedy that circumvents the polarized @entity81 . but if that is not possible , democrats are demanding the @entity3 offer a legislative solution that they can offer as an alternative to the @entity25 plan . administration officials came to the meeting to try to convince @entity3 @entity2 not to vote for the @entity26 bill , saying it would gum up the system and result in higher premiums for most @entity94 , sources told @entity55 . " they were talking about the ultimate impact of voting for it . that , in fact , it would allow plans that had high deductibles , very poor coverage -- which of course we want to get rid of , " said @entity98 , @entity99 . @entity75 rep. @entity107 of @entity108 told reporters he thinks something will " develop over the next 24 hours . " @entity3 spokesman @entity111 said " you can expect " the @entity14 administration to announce plans for addressing health policy cancellations under @entity8 " sooner rather than later . " @entity111 said president @entity14 has asked " his team " to come up with policy options , suggesting they were moving quickly . he again rejected the @entity26 bill as " not an effective fix " because it opens up the plans to anyone , not just the people who 's plans are being canceled . lawmakers also expressed frustration with the @entity130 website , the chief portal for people who want to sign up for @entity8 through the federal government . it 's october 1 launch was a debacle and the administration is scrambling to get it running up to speed . @entity3 tech expert says healthcare.gov getting better source : nov. deadline possible rep. @entity141 of @entity41 asked administration officials to stop using " red lines " they may have to cross and make the public relations problems worse for @entity2 . for example , sources in the meeting said she is worried that if the the website is not running smoothly by november 30 as the administration has promised , the political problems for @entity2 will be worse . though , the focus is chiefly on the @entity3 bill over cancellations . it would allow affected insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the @entity8 by allowing anyone to purchase them , even though the existing policies do n't meet the tougher requirements of the @entity8 initiative . can @entity81 really save insurance plans lost under @entity8 ? among other things , the law prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health , prenatal care and other issues . this is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage . cancellations drive concern although the rocky rollout of the @entity8 website and low enrollment figures through wednesday -- just over 100,000 -- are embarrassments for the president and @entity2 in @entity81 who rammed through the health law in 2010 without @entity25 support , it is the policy cancellations that are really driving @entity2 to put more pressure the @entity3 . @entity14 has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his @entity8 woes , according to the latest polling . his approval rating among @entity94 voters has dropped to its lowest number in @entity198 polling since he became president with new doubts being raised about trust . pressure to come up with a fix rep. @entity204 , the no. 2 @entity11 in the @entity3 , told reporters on tuesday that @entity14 needs to come up with a solution " sooner rather than later . " @entity108 rep. @entity207 , chairman of the @entity208 , criticized the @entity3 @entity25 plan , saying he believed it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections . " we should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and does n't make the problem worse . " @entity217 told reporters tuesday , saying it would be helpful if the @entity3 came out with a proposal before friday 's @entity3 vote . but rep. @entity222 of @entity223 , a loyal liberal and former @entity224 , said he has n't seen details of the @entity3 @entity25 bill , but said he thought it could " make sense " and that there " could be support " depending on the approach . @entity204 said earlier he had n't ruled out being open to @entity26 's bill , but his spokeswoman says he 's now opposed since @entity26 has said he wo n't make changes and @entity75 leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it . more pressure on @entity14 boosting pressure further on @entity14 was former president @entity239 , who said on tuesday that the president should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies . @entity239 : @entity14 should ' honor commitment ' on keeping health plans a growing number of @entity2 have called for changes or delays to the program as many face tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents . @entity8 rattling @entity75 nerves although he did n't go nearly as far as @entity239 , sen. @entity257 , @entity99 , said he is open to changes as well and noted that @entity14 should have been more careful with his words in the first place . sen. @entity260 of @entity261 , introduced a narrower bill than what @entity3 @entity25 are planning with @entity26 's plan and said that she has growing support in the @entity266 , including @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 -- all @entity2 . she noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance , which she says makes up about 5 % of the market , to keep their coverage . insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met . a @entity266 @entity75 leadership aide told @entity55 that @entity3 officials will go to @entity1 on thursday to meet with @entity282 about looking for a fix . @entity8 promises : where things stand official : hackers tried repeatedly to attack @entity8 website many in @entity81 avoiding @entity8 exchanges
