( @entity0 ) -- historically , surveillance was difficult and expensive . over the decades , as technology advanced , surveillance became easier and easier . today , we find ourselves in a world of ubiquitous surveillance , where everything is collected , saved , searched , correlated and analyzed . but while technology allowed for an increase in both corporate and government surveillance , the private and public sectors took very different paths to get there . the former always collected information about everyone , but over time , collected more and more of it , while the latter always collected maximal information , but over time , collected it on more and more people . corporate surveillance has been on a path from minimal to maximal information . corporations always collected information on everyone they could , but in the past they did n't collect very much of it and only held it as long as necessary . when surveillance information was expensive to collect and store , companies made do with as little as possible . telephone companies collected long - distance calling information because they needed it for billing purposes . credit cards collected only the information about their customers ' transactions that they needed for billing . stores hardly ever collected information about their customers , maybe some personal preferences , or name - and - address for advertising purposes . even @entity48 , back in the beginning , collected far less information about its users than it does today . as technology improved , corporations were able to collect more . as the cost of data storage became cheaper , they were able to save more data and for a longer time . and as big data analysis tools became more powerful , it became profitable to save more . today , almost everything is being saved by someone -- probably forever . examples are everywhere . internet companies like @entity48 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 collect everything we do online at their sites . third - party cookies allow those companies , and others , to collect data on us wherever we are on the @entity74 . store affinity cards allow merchants to track our purchases . @entity78 and aerial surveillance combined with automatic face recognition allow companies to track our movements ; so does your cell phone . the internet will facilitate even more surveillance , by more corporations for more purposes . on the government side , surveillance has been on a path from individually targeted to broadly collected . when surveillance was manual and expensive , it could only be justified in extreme cases . the warrant process limited police surveillance , and resource restraints and the risk of discovery limited national intelligence surveillance . specific individuals were targeted for surveillance , and maximal information was collected on them alone . as technology improved , the government was able to implement ever - broadening surveillance . the @entity107 could surveil groups -- the @entity111 government , the @entity113 diplomatic corps , etc. -- not just individuals . eventually , they could spy on entire communications trunks . now , instead of watching one person , the @entity107 can monitor " three hops " away from that person -- an ever widening network of people not directly connected to the person under surveillance . using sophisticated tools , the @entity107 can surveil broad swaths of the @entity74 and phone network . governments have always used their authority to piggyback on corporate surveillance . why should they go through the trouble of developing their own surveillance programs when they could just ask corporations for the data ? for example we just learned that the @entity107 collects e-mail , im and social networking contact lists for millions of internet users worldwide . but as corporations started collecting more information on populations , governments started demanding that data . through @entity147 , the @entity146 can surveil huge groups of people without obtaining a warrant . through secret agreements , the @entity107 can monitor the entire @entity74 and telephone networks . this is a huge part of the public - private surveillance partnership . the result of all this is we 're now living in a world where both corporations and governments have us all under pretty much constant surveillance . data is a byproduct of the information society . every interaction we have with a computer creates a transaction record , and we interact with computers hundreds of times a day . even if we do n't use a computer -- buying something in person with cash , say -- the merchant uses a computer , and the data flows into the same system . everything we do leaves a data shadow , and that shadow is constantly under surveillance . data is also a byproduct of information society socialization , whether it be e-mail , instant messages or conversations on @entity64 . conversations that used to be ephemeral are now recorded , and we are all leaving digital footprints wherever we go . @entity189 's law has made computing cheaper . all of us have made computing ubiquitous . and because computing produces data , and that data equals surveillance , we have created a world of ubiquitous surveillance . now we need to figure out what to do about it . this is more than reining in the @entity107 or fining a corporation for the occasional data abuse . we need to decide whether our data is a shared societal resource , a part of us that is inherently ours by right , or a private good to be bought and sold . writing in @entity211 , @entity210 said that " information is power , and the necessary corollary is that privacy is freedom . " how this interplay between power and freedom play out in the information age is still to be determined . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .

he says today @placeholder can piggyback on corporate surveillance ; they 're like partners
