( @entity0 ) -- former @entity4 sen. @entity3 , who embodied a vanishing breed of liberal @entity6 before switching to the @entity7 at the twilight of his political career , died sunday after a long battle with cancer , his family announced . @entity3 died of complications from @entity14 's lymphoma at his home in @entity16 , his family said . he was 82 . the veteran @entity18 politician had overcome numerous serious illnesses over the past two decades , including a brain tumor . he had been in the public eye since serving as a member of the @entity23 , which investigated the assassination of president @entity25 . @entity3 was elected to the @entity26 in 1980 and represented @entity18 for 30 years , longer than anyone in the state 's history . his politically moderate image fit hand - in - glove in the politically blue @entity32 , both with its @entity7 centrists and its liberal @entity34 . he was also one of @entity4 's most prominent @entity36 politicians , a rare @entity34 in a category dominated by @entity7 over the decades . and his name is synonymous with @entity18 , an idiosyncratic state that pushes and pulls between the two parties , and his home , the staunchly @entity7 city of @entity16 . in 2006 , @entity16 magazine called him " one of the few true wild cards of @entity45 politics ... reviled by those on both the right and the left . " " @entity50 and churlish , brilliant and pedantic , he can be fiercely independent , entertainingly eccentric and simply maddening , " the profile read . former gov. @entity51 , a @entity52 , called @entity3 " a mentor , colleague and a political institution " who " did more for the people of @entity18 over his more than 30 - year career with the possible exception of @entity60 . " and @entity62 , the @entity34 who now holds @entity3 's old @entity26 seat , praised him as " a man of sharp intelligence and dogged determination . " and at the @entity69 , president @entity68 said @entity3 " was always a fighter . " " from his days stamping out corruption as a prosecutor in @entity16 to his three decades of service in the @entity26 , @entity3 was fiercely independent -- never putting party or ideology ahead of the people he was chosen to serve , " @entity68 said in a written statement on @entity3 's death . and vice president @entity81 lamented the loss of " my friend , " " who never walked away from his principles and was at his best when they were challenged . " @entity81 will travel to @entity87 , @entity18 , on tuesday for @entity3 's funeral , according to the @entity69 . @entity89 , director of the @entity90 and professor of pubic affairs at @entity90 , said @entity93 's song " @entity94 " could apply to @entity3 . " there is n't any doubt in many respects he was an unusual politician , " @entity89 said . " he did n't look at polls . he did n't track how his comments were playing out in the press . ... " he was fundamentally a pragmatist who could bend with the times , " @entity89 said , and he believed greatly that government could help people . " the republicanism in his day , it was a different kind of @entity34 . he was a @entity16 , and not into that staunchly conservative @entity6 that we see " today . readers wished the best for @entity3 @entity89 called @entity3 an " indefatigable " public figure , highly demanding of both himself and those who worked for him over the years . he had a few election losses but he was undeterred by defeat , the prospects of losing and the challenges he faced . " the last thing you would have thought about @entity3 was that he was born in @entity120 , " @entity89 said . " he always came across as kind of urbane . he had a kind of caustic sense of humor . " but @entity3 in fact was born in @entity127 , the youngest child of @entity129 and @entity130 , an immigrant from @entity131 . he grew up in @entity132 , @entity120 , also the hometown of another @entity34 icon , a one - time presidential nominee and senator , @entity137 . after graduating from @entity138 in 1947 , @entity3 first went to the @entity139 . but he eventually went east for his higher education . he earned a bachelor 's degree in international relations in 1951 from the @entity143 , in @entity16 , where he graduated @entity144 . he was in the @entity145 during the @entity146 from 1951 to 1953 , serving as a second lieutenant in the @entity148 . he returned to his studies and graduated from @entity150 in 1956 . after @entity150 , he started practicing law and became an assistant district attorney in @entity16 . he served on the @entity23 at the recommendation of rep. @entity154 , later president . @entity3 is credited with co-authoring the " single bullet theory , " which suggested that some of the wounds to @entity25 and then - @entity159 gov. @entity158 were caused by the same bullet . even though he was a registered @entity52 , @entity3 ran successfully for @entity16 district attorney on the @entity34 ticket in 1965 and eventually registered as a @entity34 . he lost an election for @entity16 mayor in 1967 . he served as district attorney until 1974 and prosecuted corruption cases against @entity16 magistrates and @entity167 . @entity3 ran for the @entity26 in 1976 , but he was defeated in the @entity34 primary by @entity169 . he ran for governor but was defeated by @entity171 in the primary . but he won his bid for @entity26 in 1980 and distinguished himself , serving until 2011 . " during his tenure in the @entity26 , @entity3 championed @entity18 's economy and took an active interest in foreign affairs , meeting with dozens of world leaders as well as supporting appropriations to fight the global hiv / aids pandemic and backing free trade agreements between the @entity4 and under - developed countries , " according to a bio from the @entity184 . he served on the @entity185 , of which he was chairman from 2005 to 2007 . he served as chairman of the @entity187 from 1995 to 1997 . and he was a senior member of the @entity188 . @entity3 brought more financial resources to @entity18 than anyone in the state , working with mayors and other local leaders to help them get grants and aid , @entity89 said . and he 's remembered across the state 's 67 counties for his efforts . " he did n't shy away from pork , " @entity89 said . he participated in the confirmation hearings of 14 @entity4 @entity202 nominees , the @entity87 bio says . he is remembered for leading the charge against conservative nominee @entity204 and going after @entity205 , who accused nominee @entity206 of harassment . " no member of @entity209 shaped the @entity202 more than he did , " @entity89 said . " he had a prosecutorial mindset . he could be incredibly persuasive as an interrogator . " @entity3 straddled right and left . he criticized republicans for president @entity214 's impeachment and voted in favor of the @entity217 war . he supported embryonic stem cell research . during the 1990s , he briefly announced a run for president but eventually dropped the effort and endorsed @entity137 . despite his longtime membership in the @entity34 , @entity3 became more alienated from the party as it grew more conservative . like many of his moderate compatriots , he came to be viewed by the new conservatives as a @entity227 -- a @entity227 . decades after he switched to the @entity34 , he changed his stripes again . he became a @entity52 in 2009 , saying republicans had moved too far to the right and embraced social conservatism . the move gave @entity7 a 60 - seat filibuster - proof majority in the @entity26 . but in 2010 , when he ran for re-election , @entity3 lost the @entity7 primary to rep. @entity236 . @entity236 , who went on to lose the race to @entity62 , praised @entity3 via @entity238 as " a warrior of inestimable public service . " after the loss , @entity3 moved from the halls of @entity209 to those of academia , taking on a new role at the @entity184 as an adjunct professor . " @entity3 's knowledge of the inner workings of the government and lawmaking is second to none , " said @entity247 , the law school 's dean . " the insight he brings from his career in public service , particularly as a leader on judicial issues , will be invaluable to our students as they prepare for their own careers in the law . " the senator practiced law when he was n't in office and authored books throughout his career , including : -- " passion for truth : from finding @entity270 's @entity269 to questioning @entity205 to @entity271 " -- " never give in : battling cancer in the @entity26 " -- " life among the @entity274 : a @entity275 , a @entity276 , and the end of @entity277 as we know it " " for the past quarter - century , he 's also been a zelig - like national figure , " the @entity16 magazine article said , referring to the @entity281 character from the film of the same name who changed his persona as his surroundings and circumstances changed . " from his role in sinking @entity204 's @entity202 nomination to his cross-examination of @entity205 , from stem - cell research to the impeachment of @entity214 , @entity3 's greatest talent may be his unique ability to put himself -- somehow , some way -- in the center of the nation 's most important debates , " the article said . obituaries 2012 : the lives they 've lived @entity0 's @entity305 in @entity16 contributed to this report .
