( @entity0 ) -- @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 is attempting to flip attacks on his business record by accusing the @entity6 administration of shipping @entity8 jobs overseas , but experts in the industry he 's singling out say the truth is more complicated . " it 's interesting when it comes to outsourcing , this president has been outsourcing a good deal of @entity8 jobs by putting money into energy companies that end up making their products outside the @entity8 , " @entity1 told an audience in @entity13 on tuesday . " if there 's an outsourcer - in - chief , it 's the president of the @entity8 , not the guy running to replace him . " it 's an attempt at political jujitsu -- or as @entity30 spokesman @entity29 put it , a jeer of " i know you are but what am i ? " dems , @entity2 worlds apart in @entity35 a website put up by the @entity2 lists case after case of international companies that received federal money aimed at building up a domestic renewable energy industry or developing electric vehicles . much of it came from the @entity6 administration 's 2009 economic stimulus bill , and the @entity1 campaign and the @entity2 say that taxpayer money created jobs overseas . " it turns out president @entity6 is the outsourcer . you certainly wo n't hear about this from the @entity6 campaign , " @entity1 spokeswoman @entity51 said in an e-mail to reporters . but the programs the @entity2 paints as " outsourcing " have contributed to a boom in wind and solar energy projects in particular , according to industry groups and independent analysts . that led to the creation of between 52,000 and 75,000 jobs in the sector between 2009 and 2011 , according to an april estimate from the @entity69 in @entity70 . the range reflects some uncertainty about how much of those projects ' component parts were made in the @entity8 . that 's because there were few @entity8 companies manufacturing those components in the last decade . " you ca n't outsource jobs that were n't here in the first place , " said @entity79 , an investigative journalist who documented the role of overseas corporations in the federal energy programs in 2010 . @entity79 said the plan was to encourage those companies to locate in the @entity8 , a plan that has worked to some extent . " you ca n't just will a manufacturing industry to arise , " he said . " you have to create a market for it . the market needs the turbines from somewhere , so they had to go overseas with hopes that it would spur activity here . " wind - powered electrical production more than doubled between 2008 and 2011 , and now represents just under 3 % of @entity8 generation , @entity101 figures show . the @entity104 , the agency 's trade group , said the number of workers building components for the industry has grown from about 4,000 in 2005 to about 30,000 in 2012 . about 60 % of wind - turbine components are now made in the @entity8 , up from about 25 % in 2005 , the trade group said . @entity1 draws boos from @entity113 , support from conservatives the @entity2 website criticizes the fact that employment in the entire wind energy sector has declined by 10,000 despite the federal investment of nearly $ 9 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus bill . but the industry said that 's largely because there are fewer jobs installing wind farms right now , and that the stimulus program saved as many as 40,000 of the 85,000 jobs in the industry at its peak . those programs provided tax credits to wind - farm developers , and all those projects " are built in the @entity8 , " the @entity104 said . @entity79 said the result was a " huge " growth in installed capacity , but fewer jobs than predicted . other programs have n't been as successful , and the end of the programs in the stimulus bill could bring the renewable energy industry 's recent momentum to a " screeching halt , " he said . the " outsourcer - in - chief " attack is @entity1 's rebuttal to criticism of his business record by the @entity6 campaign and its allies , who accuse the onetime @entity153 chief of being a " pioneer " of shipping @entity8 jobs overseas . @entity6 partisans cite reporting by the @entity158 , which published a lengthy piece on @entity1 's record at @entity153 in june , but the newspaper 's fact - checking column has said the campaign has stretched the paper 's findings . " there is an element here of ' i know you are but what am i ? ' to this charge , but the facts tell a different story , " @entity29 said wednesday . he said the stimulus money " went to operations in the @entity8 that created jobs for @entity8 workers here at home . " meanwhile , observers like @entity180 , an economist at the liberal - leaning @entity181 , say @entity6 has n't done enough to crack down on outsourcing . " there 's no question that there 's concerns about candidate @entity1 , that he has outsourced in the past and indicated that he continues to favor tax policies that would subsidize companies that would outsource , " said @entity180 . " on the other hand , @entity6 has had four years to undertake major steps to reduce our trade deficit . he 's done the small things . " @entity195 : dead heat in @entity6 - @entity1 race the administration has come out in favor of shifting tax breaks away from companies that move jobs overseas and toward companies that bring them back to the @entity8 , but those moves have gone nowhere in @entity206 . @entity180 said the @entity6 administration has stepped up enforcement actions against unfair trade practices by @entity211 companies . but it " has n't taken the big steps " like taking @entity213 to task for keeping its currency artificially low , which favors @entity211 exports . @entity6 , @entity1 ratchet up back and forth over outsourcing @entity1 says he ' expected ' negative response @entity0 's @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .

both @entity1 and @placeholder are weak on outsourcing , a liberal economist says
