@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- gov. @entity3 will need to flesh out the image of the " hockey mom " she presented to the @entity6 and start to educate voters on what she believes about the issues they care about . gov. @entity3 will need to expand on her " hockey mom " image . socially conservative , blue - collar voters in the critical swing states of @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are likely to find a lot to like in the moose - hunting , gun - toting , hard - talking mother of five . but the @entity22 governor is still largely an unknown figure , and many voters - particularly independents - will have questions about her views on a range of policy issues . " the biggest question hanging over @entity3 : is she ready to take over as president , " @entity2 senior political analyst @entity30 said . " she has two months to convince voters she is . she can talk about her experience , but what will count is how she handles herself under the pressure of the campaign . " in her speech to the @entity6 , she did n't get into details on the economy , education or higher energy prices , except to call for more drilling offshore and in the @entity44 of @entity22 . a @entity45 conducted august 29 - 31 , the weekend after @entity46 picked @entity3 as a running mate , found that 38 percent of those polled had a favorable opinion of the @entity22 governor while 21 percent had an unfavorable view . but 41 percent said they were unfamiliar with @entity3 . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percent . voters will want to know more about @entity3 's social views , particularly her views on abortion , which are to the right of public opinion . @entity3 's decision not to abort her child after she learned that he had down syndrome made her a favorite of anti-abortion advocates , but her opposition to abortion rights , including in the cases of rape and incest , may turn off suburban women , particularly those who supported @entity72 . watch what @entity3 believes on the issues » @entity3 , despite her statement wednesday night that she was not going to @entity76 to " seek the good opinion " of @entity76 's elite , will also have to face the media . she has not had any one - on - one interviews since she was tapped as @entity46 's running mate . " after the convention , @entity3 will face a tough news conference , just as @entity84 did in 1984 and @entity85 did in 1988 , " @entity30 said . " @entity84 handled her news conference so skillfully , the press effectively declared her innocent even though she really did n't answer all their questions . " @entity91 provides @entity3 a model for how to handle the press , " he said . " @entity85 , not so much . " and @entity3 will face more questions about her role in the evolving " trooper-gate " scandal in which a former public safety commissioner says he was terminated because he did not fire an @entity22 state trooper who was going through a divorce from @entity3 's sister . furthermore , @entity3 must prepare for her debate with the @entity103 's vice presidential nominee , sen. @entity102 . @entity102 , the chairman of the @entity105 @entity104 , has been in the @entity105 for more than three decades and is considered one of the foremost foreign policy experts in the @entity109 . watch @entity102 say he was impressed by @entity3 » he is also known as a skilled debater , but his direct , slashing style may backfire if it appears he is beating up on the @entity6 's first female vice presidential pick . @entity3 will need to show a command of crucial economic and foreign policy challenges facing the country and demonstrate how her experience as an elected official has prepared her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency . @entity3 has served less then two years as @entity22 's governor . before winning her state 's stop office , she served on @entity22 's oil and gas board and was mayor of her hometown of @entity126 . she gave a strong speech wednesday night in her primetime debut , and she has accomplished something that had eluded @entity46 before the @entity6 convention : she has fired up the conservative base . " i did not want that to end last night . ... i did n't want the night to end , " conservative radio talk show host @entity133 said thursday . " this lady has turned it all around . ... from now on , on this program , @entity46 will be known as ' @entity138 . ' " @entity3 appeared completely comfortable with the " attack dog " role often played by vice presidential nominees . in fact , she opened her speech wednesday night by joking that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick . watch @entity3 slam @entity148 » @entity3 then went on to relentlessly attack the @entity151 ticket , including mocking the @entity148 's time as a community organizer in @entity154 . " i guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organizer , except that you have actual responsibilities , " @entity3 said . the @entity6 delegates in the hall enthusiastically received the line , but many independent voters may be turned away by @entity3 's biting , sarcastic tone . watch @entity165 call @entity3 's sarcasm unappealing » " it is clear from tonight 's national debut that @entity3 may connect extremely well in rural , small - town @entity169 , and , no doubt , @entity172 will be sending her there in key states like @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and the like . " @entity174 , a @entity2 senior political analyst , said after @entity3 's speech . " her pit bull style -- combined with her humor and presence along with her roots -- will likely draw people to her . lots of people there will look forward to hearing her in person . " the question for me is whether she will also appeal in suburban @entity169 , " he said . " i am not at all certain that she will . her combative , anti-elitist style along with her staunch conservatism on issues like abortion may just leave a lot of voters cool , if not cold . " @entity2 's @entity195 contributed to this report .
