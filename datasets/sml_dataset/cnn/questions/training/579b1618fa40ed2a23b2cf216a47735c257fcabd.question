( @entity0 ) -- " mr. speaker , we are being slaughtered , we are being exterminated , " cried out @entity1 in a devastating appeal to the @entity4 parliament that deserves the attention of the entire world . everyone should watch . the @entity4 legislator , a member of the country 's @entity11 minority , collapsed at the end of her heartbreaking plea , imploring her country to stop the genocide of her people . " in the name of humanity , " she said , " save us ! save us ! " the @entity11 are caught in the brutal march of the @entity21 in @entity4 and @entity22 , or @entity23 , the extremist @entity24 organization . it has called itself the @entity21 , and has anointed itself the caliphate and its leader the ruler of all the world 's @entity29 . @entity23 is carving a path of destruction as it sets its sights on imposing its rule , and its interpretation of @entity36 , on @entity4 , @entity22 , @entity37 , @entity38 and beyond . in the process of achieving its military gains , @entity23 is massing large caches of weaponry , taking over oil fields in @entity4 , filling its coffers with cash and developing what could eventually become enormous military , economic and political power , if it is able to achieve its objectives . preventing genocide , saving the @entity11 , is an imperative humanitarian goal in itself . but stopping @entity23 , the @entity53 offshoot that is too extreme even for @entity53 , is important for preventing an even more disastrous turn in the boiling @entity55 , and it is indispensable for global stability . it was n't just @entity1 asking for help , and it 's not only up to the dysfunctional @entity4 parliament to provide support . there is an important role for world powers -- for the @entity64 -- in helping save the @entity55 from one of the most ruthless and dangerous organizations operating today in one of the most important parts of the globe . who is the @entity23 ? @entity4 's @entity73 , in the north of the country , are brave and determined . they love the @entity64 , which twice helped them survive the genocidal efforts of @entity76 . their army , known as the @entity79 ( " those who confront death , " in @entity80 ) , have been fighting against @entity23 , but they are outgunned . that 's partly because the @entity4 army dropped its ( @entity64 ) weapons and fled when @entity23 rolled in from @entity22 and captured @entity86 . the @entity73 are prepared to challenge @entity23 , and there is no one better to do it . they are moderate , @entity89 , committed to a multiethnic , religiously diverse @entity4 and ready for the challenge . they have everything to gain from victory and everything to lose from defeat . @entity64 should help arm them . skeptics have worried that by helping to stop the @entity98 of @entity23 , the @entity64 would be siding with @entity99 . but the @entity73 are the perfect way to avoid that binary trap . opponents of arming the @entity73 also worry that it might add to the disintegration of @entity4 . that is not necessarily the case . if @entity4 survives , it should do so only as a federal state , in which @entity98 , @entity29 and @entity73 share power . if @entity4 does not survive , and @entity4 @entity73 at long last get a state of their own , it would hardly be a catastrophic outcome . the @entity73 deserve a state as much as any other people , but they have been patient and loyal in helping @entity4 survive . the @entity73 , who lost hundreds of thousands of their people to @entity76 's genocidal @entity117 campaign , today deserve a chance to help save @entity4 -- and themselves . @entity23 is on the march , killing people , gleefully boasting about its savagery , while destroying ancient minority communities . @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , in addition to @entity29 , have endured the brutality of their new rulers . in @entity86 , @entity4 's second - largest city , captured in june , @entity125 have been ordered to convert or face death . for the first time since the advent of @entity134 , there are no @entity125 in @entity86 . the fate of the @entity11 may be even worse . as @entity1 told the parliament , " an entire religion is being exterminated from the face of the @entity138 . " she called it " a campaign of genocide . " the chamber listened awkwardly as she described the plight of the ancient @entity11 , a religious minority that has faced discrimination and persecution over the centuries , but has managed to survive . until now . @entity11 ' religious beliefs are a combination of the @entity154 @entity153 faith , with elements of @entity36 and even @entity156 . @entity23 calls them " devil worshipers . " the world now faces two urgent challenges : to prevent the genocide of the @entity11 and to stop @entity23 from continuing to conquer swaths of the @entity55 . bombing @entity23 positions would help save the @entity11 , but supporting the @entity73 is key to success on both counts . since taking over @entity86 , not far from where most @entity11 live , @entity23 has killed hundreds of @entity11 men . women , as @entity1 said , " are being taken as slaves and sold in the slave market . " over the weekend , @entity23 fighters launched a new offensive and pushed out the @entity79 who had protected the @entity11 . the @entity11 town of @entity174 fell to @entity23 , and the population fled by the tens of thousands into the mountains , to escape the jihadists ' cruelty . the displaced people can barely survive in their mountain hideout . @entity182 announced that 40 @entity11 children already have died . huge numbers of @entity11 are surrounded by @entity23 , with no water and no food . @entity182 estimates up to 25,000 of them are children in desperate need of assistance . @entity1 's cry was addressed to her fellow members of the @entity4 parliament , but the leader of the @entity11 extended a much wider appeal to world powers -- an appeal no less desperate for its dignified understatement . under the heading " urgent distress call from the @entity201 " a letter addressed to @entity80 and @entity4 leaders , to the international community , and to mr. @entity204 , @entity205 . prince @entity201 , who described himself as leader of the world 's @entity11 , explained that his people are peaceful , respect all religions , and have helped others in their hour of humanitarian need . today , he said , " they desperately need their brethren 's help . " come to the assistance of the @entity11 people , he asked , " as soon as possible . " to ignore his plea would be to stand back and make way for genocide . we have been warned .
