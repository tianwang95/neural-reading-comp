( @entity0 ) -- the facts show , and president @entity2 and his @entity4 challenger @entity3 agree , that @entity6 production of oil and gas has increased over the past four years . but is this rise because of @entity2 , or " in spite of his policies , " as the former @entity10 governor said at wednesday night 's debate ? " all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land , not on government land , " @entity3 said . " on government land , your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half . " the facts : the @entity4 nominee 's assertions can be broken down into two parts . the first has to do whether " all of the increases in natural gas and oil " under @entity2 are attributable to drilling on private land , rather than federal and @entity35 lands and offshore areas . this statement raises a few questions . firstly , has there been more oil and gas production , relatively , on private lands versus federal lands ? secondly , does the federal government , through regulations and license approvals , have any impact on oil and gas production on private land ? and last , can " all " the increase in production be tied to production on private lands ? there is no dispute that natural gas production on private lands has increased . @entity60 , head of the @entity61 , told a congressional subcommittee in august that it went up " by 16.4 billion cubic feet per day " from fiscal year 2005 to fiscal year 2011 , which ended september 30 , 2011 -- a period that includes parts of the administrations of both president @entity67 and @entity2 . meanwhile , natural gas production on federal and @entity35 lands has steadily fallen , a trend that began around fall 2002 . this is due to a consistent decrease in offshore gas drilling , though such gas production onshore , on federal lands , is actually higher now than it was at the end of the @entity67 administration . overall , the percentage of @entity6 - produced natural gas from federal lands -- relative to that produced from private ones -- fell significantly over the past eight years , from 35 % to 21 % , reported @entity60 . oil production is more a mixed bag . on state and private lands , oil production was actually going down in the 2000s , leveled off between fiscal years 2007 and 2010 , then went up by 385,000 barrels a day in fiscal year 2011 , when the most recent data are available , @entity60 said . on federal and @entity35 lands , as well as federally approved offshore drilling sites , oil production went up from 1.6 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels per day between fiscal years 2008 and 2010 . but it dropped to 1.8 million barrels per day for the last fiscal year available , a decrease that the @entity61 attributes to the impact of the @entity103 oil spill in the @entity104 . despite the one - year drop in production , oil production on federal and @entity35 lands from 2009 through 2011 totaled 2.027 million barrels . that 's an average of 675,000 barrels per year during @entity2 's term , compared to an average annual production of 609,000 barrels annually during @entity67 's last term . now , moving onto the second part of @entity3 's statement -- that @entity2 's " administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half . " the @entity121 , a nonprofit research and advocacy group that has been critical of @entity2 , asserted in a september 26 report that the rate of oil and gas leasing ( or licenses , as @entity3 stated ) " has slowed by about half . " it then directs readers to a chart on the federal @entity130 's website . this chart does show that fewer leases have been granted under the first three years of @entity2 's administration , compared to the last few years under @entity67 . fewer drilling permits have also been issued , for these lands . during the last three fiscal years totally under @entity67 , there were 9,661 " new leases " granted for federal lands . for the three most recent fiscal years ( which includes a few months of @entity67 's administration ) , there were 5,568 such new leases . this works out to a 42.4 % decrease . take the same comparable periods for drilling permits on federal lands . there were 20,479 for the last three years under @entity67 , then 12,821 for the most recent three including much of @entity2 's first term . this is a 37.4 % decrease . complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity150 conclusion : there has been more oil and natural production on private lands than in federally controlled areas . so @entity3 is correct in pointing out an imbalance . but it is an overstatement to say that " all of the increase " has been on private lands -- since , by definition , new permits and licenses have been granted for federal lands ( bringing in more gas and oil ) . @entity3 's claim that @entity2 's administration has " cut the number of permits and licenses in half " for federal lands is also not on the mark . true , there has been a significant drop -- one tied , in part , to the unprecedented @entity103 oil spill . yet the actual numbers of permits and licenses have n't been " cut ... in half . " as mentioned above ( and including data from part of the @entity67 administration ) , there has been a 42 % decrease in leases and 37 % decrease in drilling permits -- not 50 % , as @entity3 implied . even the @entity121 acknowledged that " this decrease is n't a result of president @entity2 's policies exclusively , but it is the result of decades and policies that have systematically reduced energy production on federal lands . " fact check : is @entity196 a small business ? fact check : job creation versus unemployment fact check : @entity203 energy fact check : seniors ' drug prices @entity0 's @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .

@placeholder : the whole rise in @entity6 gas and oil production " happened on private land "
