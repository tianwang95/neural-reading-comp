( @entity0 ) -- so you 're finally ready to settle down and make that marriage proposal ? there 's no better time to do it than engagement season , which , lucky for you , is now ! get inspired by these uber - romantic celebrity proposals . @entity7 popped the question to @entity9 while on a picnic . @entity11 and @entity12 although the set of a slasher movie seems an unlikely place for romance to bloom , that 's just where it happened for actors @entity11 and @entity12 . shortly after shooting began in 1999 on their film " @entity23 , " the co-stars started spending time together . seven years later , on christmas day 2006 , @entity12 , 32 , told @entity11 , 30 , that he wanted to give her a promise ring . then , as her entire family looked on , the " @entity26 " actor yelled , " @entity30 ! " and got down on one knee to present her with a 1.5 - carat diamond engagement ring . @entity31 and @entity32 @entity31 , an @entity33 linebacker , met @entity32 during a celebrity appearance at an @entity35 . @entity32 , a model at the event , instantly caught his eye . @entity31 and @entity32 ( who now hosts @entity39 ) were inseparable over the next six months . in february 2007 , @entity31 treated @entity32 to a helicopter ride above @entity41 , @entity42 , before dining at @entity44 's @entity43 . famous for its chocolate @entity46 cake , @entity31 conspired with the restaurant 's manager to place the engagement ring atop the confection , which was covered with pink rose petals . @entity53 and @entity54 @entity53 got more than he bargained for after hiring @entity54 to be the band 's webmaster in december 2000 . @entity54 went on tour with the group and quickly grew close to @entity53 . six years later , the couple attended a @entity60 at the @entity62 home of @entity54 's father . " i figured , what better timing , " says @entity53 , " because all of her family was going to be there , including her 92 - year - old grandmother . " just before the stroke of midnight , @entity53 made a toast and presented @entity54 with a custom - designed three - stone diamond engagement ring . @entity7 and @entity9 three years before actor @entity7 donned those famous blue tights , he tended bar at @entity76 in @entity77 . during a party there in 2003 , actress @entity9 repeatedly poured out the drinks he made her as a ruse to chat him up . " i kept asking him for another drink , telling him the one before was too strong , " she recalls . in 2006 , @entity7 purchased the 3 - carat diamond ring that had caught @entity85 's eye during an earlier visit to @entity87 . but since the two were traveling for the @entity90 press tour , @entity7 asked @entity91 , one of the film 's producers , to hold the ring until they arrived in @entity95 . " poor man ! " says @entity7 . " he carried it around for two and a half weeks . " finally , while picnicking in @entity98 , @entity7 popped the question . @entity100 and @entity101 @entity100 and @entity101 became friends after meeting at a party in 2006 and @entity100 immediately pegged him as perfect husband material . she found out for certain that he felt the same way just two days before christmas 2007 , under a full moon at midnight , in a bay off the coast of the @entity112 island @entity110 . the two were seated in a double kayak , taking in the bioluminescent organisms shimmering in the water all alone , except for a tour guide in a second kayak . the scene should have been pure bliss , except that @entity121 was concerned when their guide speedily paddled away . " the guy knew to take off so @entity101 could propose , but imagine how i felt floating in this huge bay in the middle of the night with nobody around , " @entity100 explains . " i started calling back , ' @entity128 , hello ! come back ! ' until i realized something was going on . " after an " amazing speech , " @entity101 pulled out a 4.3 - carat brilliant - cut diamond ring by @entity132 , @entity100 's favorite jeweler . but her joy was soon laced with anxiety over the fact that such a costly bauble was surrounded by acres of sea . " i said , ' put it away , please . i do n't want it to drop in the water ! ' " @entity142 and @entity143 actress @entity142 , 27 , best known for her role in " my girl , " was awaiting her seven - year anniversary with college sweetheart and army reservist @entity143 , 28 , and hoping he might pop the question . while they were having breakfast at a café in her neighborhood a week before their anniversary , @entity142 described a cocktail ring a friend was selling . so , who had been carrying an engagement ring for two weeks in anticipation of the perfect moment , pulled out the 1 - carat , cathedral - mounted , radiant - cut bauble and asked , " does it look anything like this ? " @entity165 & @entity166 it started out all business : @entity169 was interviewing @entity166 , first - season winner on " @entity171 " and co-host of the @entity175 , @entity174 , tv show " @entity176 with @entity177 . " but when the cameras stopped rolling in april 2006 , a whirlwind -- and adventurous -- romance began . eight months later , when @entity166 , 36 , popped the question during a chopper flight over @entity175 , complete with champagne , @entity186 's deep - dish pizza ( @entity165 's favorite ) and @entity188 tunes piped into the headset . " @entity166 told me we were going to look at @entity192 lights , " says @entity169 . " it was dark in the helicopter , so i did n't really get a look at the ring until the next day , when i went into shock for the second time , " she says of the 4 - carat cushion - cut diamond in a micro pavé setting @entity166 helped design . @entity202 and @entity203 " he was hot ! " shark star @entity202 , 39 , recalls of first glimpsing her future husband , @entity205 , 38 , at a food - related charity event four years ago . " he looked good in his chef 's hat , and he had this ornery little spark in his eye that i really enjoy . " after dating for two years , the couple opened @entity213 , their celebrated @entity215 restaurant in @entity217 , @entity218 . the proposal came soon after . " one night , @entity205 covered my eyes and took me into our bedroom , " recalls @entity220 . there the die - hard romantic had placed candles , champagne and a canvas painted with the messages " and you come with me forever " in @entity215 and " grow old along with me " in @entity95 . @entity205 then presented @entity220 with a made - to - order cushion - cut solitaire set in pavé diamonds . @entity234 and @entity235 fate has looked after @entity234 . on @entity238 2000 the actor met @entity235 , a makeup artist from @entity239 , @entity95 , while walking back from a play rehearsal in @entity241 . " i was smitten , " says @entity234 , now 36 . the @entity242 , 90210 alum and @entity235 , 27 , immediately began dating , and in 2002 they moved back to @entity218 together . that 's when fate took another turn : on august 11 , 2002 , @entity234 was driving his race car on a @entity250 track when he hit a wall at 180 mph . though he sustained three skull fractures , a broken back and a bleeding artery in his neck , he pulled through . " it was a tough time , but it was also magical because we kept each other 's spirits high , " says @entity235 . " we pushed two beds together in the hospital and put @entity261 , our @entity215 bulldog , in the middle . we were together 24 hours a day , seven days a week , for three months . " in may 2004 @entity234 arranged another trip to @entity241 , @entity95 -- to the very street corner where he and @entity235 first met , where he presented her with an emerald - cut , three - diamond ring by @entity268 . @entity269 and @entity270 what happens in @entity272 does n't always stay in @entity272 -- and for @entity269 and @entity270 , that 's not a bad thing . nearly four years ago the two ran into each other poolside at the @entity277 in @entity272 , @entity278 . " i was working on a documentary , and @entity270 offered to help , " recalls @entity269 , 35 . " he spent a week operating the microphone , but later he told me he would have done anything . i do n't think he really cared about the project , if you know what i mean . " for their first date the couple went to see the @entity288 with friends , and @entity270 had @entity269 in stitches . " it was this whole @entity270 show in my ear . that 's how it is with @entity270 . you get sucked into it ! " evidently : a year and a half later , on september 18 , 2005 , @entity270 , 33 , proposed to @entity269 in @entity42 with a diamond ring from @entity298 " i got down on one knee , asked her to marry me and said , ' you better say yes ' a couple of times -- there was a little bit of a pause on her part , " says @entity270 . @entity269 's take ?
