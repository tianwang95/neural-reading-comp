of course it matters . but many if not most @entity1 see the midterm election two weeks from tuesday as likely to change little or nothing of consequence . their lack of interest is part of the price of @entity10 gridlock and dysfunction . it is nearly impossible to see a path for action of major , controversial issues like immigration reform , a new tax system , or long overdue fixes to the big - money entitlement programs @entity20 and @entity21 . @entity23 's veteran political reporter @entity22 sums it up this way : " no matter how this goes , we 're going to have more gridlock and more politics above policy , " said @entity22 . " as we turn to 2016 , it will be angrier , more frustrated and voters will be angrier , more frustrated and looking for alternatives outside these two parties . " remember that last part -- especially if independent @entity35 wins the tight @entity37 race in traditionally ruby red @entity38 . that could send both parties a signal about the public 's disgust with politics as usual . but , for now , focus on this year . @entity46 - held seats in @entity47 , @entity48 and maybe @entity49 are within @entity51 reach but razor close . and now , @entity51 - held seats in @entity38 , @entity54 and @entity55 are in play , giving the @entity46 late hope of changing a bad 2014 hand with wild cards . related : key races to watch in 2014 this may be too volatile a year for history to matter , but history usually does matter and it suggests a decent to good @entity51 election , depending on whether those close races all break one way or the other - as often happens - or play out in a wild night of state - by - state chess . those two most likely scenarios : 1 . @entity51 add a modest number of seats to their @entity73 majority , and take control of the @entity37 with somewhere in the ballpark of 51 - 54 seats . 2 . @entity51 add a modest number of seats to their @entity73 majority , and @entity46 close strong and somehow manage to keep their @entity37 edge , with either 51 seats or a 50 - 50 tie in which vice president @entity83 breaks ties for the rest of the @entity87 administration . either way , neither party is going to be anywhere near the 60 votes it takes to do real business in the @entity37 . and president @entity87 , for all the talk of his lame duck status that is already taking hold , would still hold the bully pulpit and a veto pen . so , even if @entity51 controlled both the @entity73 and @entity37 and , even if they somehow came up with the votes to repeal @entity103 , it would trigger perhaps the fastest presidential veto in history . @entity106 , even if the @entity51 run the @entity73 and the @entity37 , they still have their own internal tensions . take immigration . speaker @entity110 and ( in the event they can achieve a slim @entity37 majority ) new senate majority leader @entity109 would like nothing more than to move beyond the immigration impasse that has stymied @entity10 for years so the @entity51 can begin to try to repair its crisis with @entity118 voters . but grassroots anger on this issue is as great as ever , and there would be an internal revolt if @entity110 or @entity123 embraced even something like legal status for the undocumented . president @entity87 has said a permanent legal status does n't go nearly far enough , but the conservative base equates it with amnesty . moving past immigration , what about the debt ? there has been no compromise on entitlement spending in recent years because @entity51 want deeper savings than @entity46 will support and there has been too much partisan grandstanding to try to work out a compromise . would total @entity51 control of @entity142 make a difference ? maybe : there would be a united @entity51 negotiating front with the @entity73 , and the president would perhaps be open to more as he considers his legacy and looks for big achievements . or maybe not : with @entity51 shy of 60 votes in the @entity37 , imagine @entity150 as the new @entity151 . she might do anything she could to gum up the works when something does n't pass her ideological muster . and do n't forget the 2016 campaign begins in earnest the day after the 2014 election . having been stunned from the left in 2008 , would @entity160 would be quiet if major entitlement trims were a possibility ? so , bottom line : maybe @entity109 replaces @entity165 in the role of man with big title -- @entity37 majority leader -- but little legislative leeway . voters get this . just ask the people working their tails off to make a difference . @entity177 conservative leaders say when their phone banks call voters , a leading response is : " why bother ? " to that point , in @entity182 last week , evangelical pastor @entity181 told me the young @entity177 in his ministry " do n't really look to @entity10 " as a place that solves the things they worry about most . http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/king-roadtrip-midterm / related : midterm mile markers - roadtrip to 2014 a little more than an hour to the north , in suburban @entity194 's @entity193 , a half dozen @entity118 voters i chatted with in a neighborhood restaurant had a healthy debate on some issues but all agreed the excitement of voting for president @entity87 had given way to a sense that every promise to them was certain to be broken . @entity203 , a volunteer for democrats in that county , says many voters she calls are " discouraged . " discouraged at dysfunction seems to be the state of the union with two weeks to go until election day . but the truth is , whatever your politics , who wins on election night matters more than you might think . do you want a @entity216 or a @entity51 as @entity218 chairman if president @entity87 has one or two @entity219 picks in the next two years ? do you want significant changes to @entity103 ? who controls the @entity37 will matter bigtime in those negotiations . @entity51 want more money for the @entity224 than the @entity73 does , and if they control both chambers of @entity142 they would have more leverage in budget talks . more leverage , perhaps , to find that money by trimming @entity229 of food stamps . that list -- of where it certainly does matter -- is a long one . but most voters do n't see it because what they have witnessed the past several years leaves them convinced -- understandably so -- that @entity10 would scew up a free lunch . take @entity239 , a waitress in @entity240 , @entity47 , who during a visit last week talked so excitedly about casting her first ballot , just 18 , in 2012 . she 's planning on siting out 2014 , because , " i do n't think it really matters . they do n't care about me . "

does it really matter if @entity46 or @placeholder are in charge after 2014 ?
