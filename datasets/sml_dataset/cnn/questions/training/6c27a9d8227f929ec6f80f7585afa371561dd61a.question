( @entity0 ) -- for @entity3 , the wild celebrations of @entity2 come before the solemnity of @entity5 , a last chance to celebrate before the abstinence marking the 40 days to @entity7 and @entity8 . @entity9 do it the other way around . first comes the month of daytime fasting during @entity16 , then the eruption of joy called @entity14 , marked with gift - giving , new clothes , donations to the poor , feasting and festivities . but as the sighting of a crescent moon officially marked the beginning of @entity14 on tuesday , feelings are decidedly mixed for many @entity9 . there 's joy tempered with concern on @entity28 in @entity29 , which saw a successful revolution topple president @entity31 this year . and there 's optimism in @entity34 , where 42 years of rule by @entity36 seem to be coming to an end . but emotions are much more muted in @entity39 , where the government is clamping down to prevent the @entity41 from spreading , and there is a sense of gloom in @entity45 , wracked by violence and natural disasters . @entity29 @entity29 are putting a revolutionary twist on the traditional @entity14 greeting " @entity49 , " meaning " a blessed @entity14 , " said engineering student @entity51 . " people are saying to each other ' @entity49 without @entity31 , ' " he said . @entity53 , an @entity29 student at the @entity54 , marked @entity14 in @entity28 , the symbolic center of the february revolution . " it was awesome seeing the @entity29 revolutionaries again with the same determination and enthusiasm , " she said . but she noticed with some concern that the long - suppressed @entity62 group , the @entity61 -- which has emerged as a major force -- was absent from the square . she was struck by a puppet show @entity61 supporters performed for children in one neighborhood . it was " full of political implications , " she said . traditionally , @entity14 prayers are a communal affair -- held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques . but in the small village of @entity78 , outside @entity79 , the imam expressed concern the @entity61 held its prayers separately , said @entity82 . the imam " mentioned that @entity85 should not be represented by the various views that started to take a political role in society , " said the medical student at @entity84 . " my father talked with the imam who said that he meant to give this kind of speech because he did n't like how the @entity85 groups are so many and different . " @entity34 @entity96 residents rang in the end of @entity16 with celebratory gunfire . it was " two times the celebration and two times the joy , " said medical student @entity101 . " i remember celebrating @entity14 for the last couple of years in @entity34 , " she said . " people seemed to be happy that it was @entity14 , but i never saw this happiness deep in their eyes ; i felt like there was a sadness deep down . " but this year was different , she said . while @entity34 mourned those who died battling the regime of @entity36 , a sense of hope permeated throughout . " when a nation wants something so badly , they will make sure that they get it ; even if means lots of death , " she said . " never underestimate the ability of a nation . " @entity39 celebrations were in short supply in @entity39 where pro-reform demonstrators took to the streets after @entity14 prayers and were met by brute force , opposition activists said . security forces violently broke up rallies in @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , activists said . " there will be no happiness while the martyrs ' blood is still warm , " said the @entity134 , an activist group . in @entity131 , a focal point in the nationwide wave of anti-government rage , @entity140 's three young children asked him , " where are our new @entity14 clothes and sweets ? " " just pray to @entity146 , " he replied . " all we 're going to do is visit the cemetery -- that 's our @entity14 , " he said . @entity45 many residents of @entity45 said they are finding little to cheer about this holiday . in @entity152 , where ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power have left dozens dead , @entity151 said @entity14 this year is a " hollow one . " " never have i felt the apathy and sadness i feel now at the death of so many of my brothers and sisters in this last month , " said @entity151 , a writer and entrepreneur in @entity45 's largest city . elsewhere in the country , rain - triggered flash floods have ruined crops and destroyed lives . " i know for a fact that this city and nation are amongst the most resilient on earth , " @entity151 said . " but even we can not just keep getting up from blow after blow of this magnitude . " @entity176 , a teacher in the capital , @entity178 , was envious of the protests sweeping throughout the @entity180 . " we hate the rulers that have hijacked our country , " she said . " we would love to have regime change in @entity45 , just like in @entity34 and @entity29 . " but she was n't optimistic : " i do n't think this @entity14 will bring about any positive change for @entity45 's future . " however , the @entity41 revolts have left many @entity9 with a distinct optimism about the future . that 's a marked change from the decades when @entity191 living under autocratic rulers would bitterly quote a verse by @entity195 - born poet @entity194 asking if @entity14 will " be the same and even more sorrow , or will you be the sign of a new day ? " for years , many @entity191 assumed the answer was more sorrow . but this year , many are saying @entity191 should be proud of what they have accomplished since the last @entity14 -- and they hold out hope for even more happiness by the next one . @entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .
