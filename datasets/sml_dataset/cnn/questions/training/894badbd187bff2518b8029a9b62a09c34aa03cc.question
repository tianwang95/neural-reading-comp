( @entity0 ) -- while most professional golfers pride themselves on using the latest whiz - bang equipment , deep within the @entity5 countryside a very different tournament is taking place -- one where the players are happily swinging antiques . in fact , anyone watching the @entity10 could be forgiven for thinking they 'd stumbled 100 years back in time . it 's not just the old - fashioned equipment -- wooden - shafted clubs that date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries -- but also the clothes : the players trek across this dramatic landscape dressed in plus fours and flat caps for the men and long skirts for the women . it 's as if they are unwitting sports hipsters . " @entity31 golf has taken on a new lease of life in the past few years because , i 'm not sure i really like the word , but it 's a bit sort of retro , " @entity28 , co-founder and director of the @entity10 , tells @entity0 . " it 's almost anti-modern in some ways . " @entity28 has played his own role in hickory golf 's ascent over the past decade with the creation of the tournament , which takes place at @entity44 on the east coast of @entity5 on tuesday and wednesday . upon joining the @entity46 -- founded in 1987 off the back of the @entity49 version created 17 years previously -- he became aware of a number of hickory events that initially grew out of members wanting to test their antique clubs . keen to promote the movement to the masses , @entity28 decided to introduce an open competition of his own that anybody could play in , and so the maiden @entity10 was staged in 2005 at the @entity59 in @entity60 , @entity5 -- recognized by many as the oldest course in the world and the oldest on which play has been continuous . " i cheekily called it the @entity10 , which was a bit of a joke really , " @entity28 says . " i held the first tournament -- 36 people played and i had to give out 36 sets of clubs . but everybody enjoyed it so much , so i said i would continue it . " and so he did , with @entity28 's brainchild having gone from strength to strength , annually touring some of @entity5 's most prestigious courses and becoming one of the world 's leading hickory tournaments in the process . next year , it will take place at @entity85 to become the first modern hickory tournament to be played on a current @entity87 course . @entity28 estimates that 90 % of the 100 - plus competitors this week -- including ex-professional golfers -- will arrive fully - stocked with their own antique equipment . " over the years it 's developed and it now really is a @entity10 , " he says . " my tournament this year will have @entity49 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity5 . " what is it that attracts these golfers from around the globe to hunt down a rare club made out of wood , when a souped - up version with the latest technological advancements is so readily available instead ? it 's a chance to play on some of the game 's oldest courses , which by today 's standards are often considered too short and antiquated due to the distance the ball can be hit with modern clubs . courses dating back to the 1930s and older are often around 1,000 yards shorter than those the likes of @entity121 and @entity122 find themselves playing on week - in , week - out , and so offer a different kind of challenge for hickory golfers , who also play with an older type of ball . " i do n't think the modern golf course can get any longer , it 's a joke , " @entity28 says . " on the great old courses you walk straight from the green onto the next tee . with the modern golf course you might walk 50 - 100 yards for the next tee , so you need an enormous piece of land and it takes you much longer to go round . " according to @entity137 , who is defending his title at @entity44 , this is golf in its purest form . " it 's all about distance in the modern game and the putting becomes even more the game inside the game , " says the 46 - year - old @entity96 golfer , a member of the @entity141 from 1989 - 2001 . " in the old days , i think the skill of the player was really more put into value , whereas today the clubs are much better than they used to be so many players can get away with hitting bad shots . " for @entity28 , that thrill of finally connecting with a more technically challenging swing is the true essence of hickory golf . " the reason i have a passion for hickory golf is because you really know when you 've hit a good shot . you do n't know when you 've had a good shot until you hit the sweet spot from the face of the club , " he says . " the modern club is much more forgiving . i know with a modern club , if i have n't connected properly i still get a result . it 's almost like you 're cheating a bit . but if i do that with a hickory , you do n't get the result . " one worry for the movement of hickory golf , however , is that , as time passes by , antique clubs inevitably begin to become that much harder to locate . fewer and fewer companies manufacture modern authentic versions today -- @entity181 is one -- and certain collectors will always prefer to hang their clubs up on the wall rather than sample them out on the golf course . some tournaments , including those held by the @entity46 , state that pre- 1935 golf clubs , and not replicas , must be used . " if i have a wish , it 's that people who are collecting the clubs considered giving some of those clubs back onto the market to try to get people into hickory golf . people would enjoy it a lot more if they had the old clubs to play with , " @entity137 says . " i have been repairing over the past few years about 10 sets of clubs , then i resell them to friends who want to start hickory golf . i do n't like to keep them in the house , i want to keep the movement of hickory golf going . " however , @entity28 is sure hickory golf will continue to attract waves of new players in the years to come . " i do n't think there 's any doubt that it will continue to grow , " he says . " i 've already been asked if i will hold a @entity10 at a golf course in 2017 to celebrate their 150th anniversary . it 's definitely got a bit of wind in its sails . "

@entity10 set for its 10th year this week at @placeholder
