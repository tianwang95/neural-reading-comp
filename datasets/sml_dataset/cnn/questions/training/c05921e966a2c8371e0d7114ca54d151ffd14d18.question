( @entity0 ) -- the night before she was killed on the streets of @entity3 , the woman the world would come to know simply as @entity6 had a dream . " there was a war going on , " she told her mom the next morning , " and i was in the front . " @entity6 's mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after @entity14 's disputed june 12 presidential election . but on that fateful morning , she told her daughter she could n't go with her . as @entity6 prepared to leave , the mother was filled with anxiety . " i told her to be very careful , and she said she would . " more than four months after @entity6 's death , her mother , @entity19 , described the pain her family has endured and how grateful they are to millions across the world who have hailed @entity6 as a martyr -- a symbol of freedom for @entity14 . she spoke with @entity0 by phone in her native @entity30 from her home in @entity3 a few days ago . " as a message to everyone , i really want to thank the whole world , " she said . " and i do n't really know how to thank them , so i ask of you : please find the right words for me . " i ca n't tell you how much it has warmed our hearts , how much it 's helped us . " there is a @entity30 expression that describes a grieving person 's need to talk about the pain in her heart , to empty her soul . and that 's what this is : a mourning mother who for months has wept and cried -- and remained silent about her daughter 's killing , until now . " this is a pain that will never heal , " she said in a gentle , hushed tone . watch mom mourn the " look in her eyes " ' i need not worry ' on june 20 , @entity64 , 26 , headed to @entity3 's @entity65 , where thousands of protesters gathered . clashes were particularly intense that day , with demonstrators and riot police squaring off . @entity6 , accompanied by her music teacher , called home with frequent updates . " @entity74 , there are just too many clashes going on . there are a lot of police and forces around . " tear gas was lobbed at the crowd . @entity6 headed to a medical clinic to get her eyes washed . " my eyes are really burning hard , " she said . twenty minutes later , @entity6 's mom reached her again . " she said she was on her way back home -- that i need not worry . " @entity6 told the same thing to her aunt and uncle , who also called to check up on her . wearing blue jeans , a black shirt and white sneakers , @entity6 walked toward her car , parked on a side street not far from the heated protests . " it did n't occur to her that anything was going to be different , " her mother said . then , @entity6 was killed . a single bullet struck her chest . recalling that day , her mother paused in the hourlong interview . the family , she said , has gone back to the scene and retraced @entity6 's movements . " she was only 26 steps from her car . " those were 26 steps @entity64 never had a chance to take -- the difference between returning home to her family and becoming a symbol of a greater struggle inside @entity14 . ' she was absolutely beautiful ' while millions across the globe were transfixed by @entity6 's death , captured on video , her family entered a traditional seven - day grieving period . her parents ' house was too small to host everyone ; they gathered at @entity6 's older sister 's home . the family , @entity6 's mother said , was barred from holding a memorial service . " i did see @entity6 when her body was being washed before burial , " she said . " when her body was covered in the white shroud for burial , when they uncovered her face , i saw her . she was absolutely beautiful -- with a smile , a beautiful smile . like an angel . " it was during the seven days of mourning , around the third or fourth day , that a relative told her about the video of @entity6 's death , by then widely watched on the @entity143 . the mother did n't watch it that first week . " but when i returned home , i did see the video , " she said . " it was enormously painful . so painful that i 've never been able to watch it again all the way through to the end . " it was the moment of seeing her give her life , the life leaving her body . that was very painful . the look in her eyes at that moment . i wake up with that look in her eyes every morning ; i go to bed with the image of that look in her eyes every evening . " she continued , " i want to say that the moment that bothers me the most -- that bothers me terribly -- is the moment @entity6 got shot . that 's because @entity6 was an extremely brave person . ever since she was a child , she was brave and fearless . so that moment when she got shot , i saw it in the video , she could n't believe it -- that she had taken a bullet . so much so that she takes a look at her body . and when she sees she 's been shot , she takes a few steps backwards and then falls . the only words she managed to utter was : ' teacher , i 'm burning . ' and people said she passed within 44 seconds . " the mother visits @entity6 's grave every friday . she 's heartened that even now , throngs of people still greet her -- " it 's as though she just passed away . " she carries with her a painting of her smiling daughter that she received as a gift . " people go and write on her grave in red ink the word ' martyr , ' " she said , " and then the authorities go and wipe it off . " blog : behind the scenes with @entity6 's mom she said her daughter 's killer is still at large , but she 's confident the person will be found and tried in court . " i am waiting for that day . " " i saw @entity6 as a martyr from the start . @entity6 was a martyr for her homeland . " a ' caring ' debater long before @entity6 became a household name , she was a " very excited girl " who always had answers for everything . " she was very well tempered and very friendly and very emotional and caring -- extremely emotional and caring , " her mother said . " she was never the type of girl who would submit to force . " in their last face - to - face conversation , the mother and daughter debated the political climate inside @entity14 . " we had a hearty debate and discussion , " her mother said . @entity64 's favorite activity was aerobics . she also liked to sunbathe at a local swimming pool . her final meal was her favorite dish : pan kabob . @entity6 was divorced , her mother said . after the divorce , @entity6 tried to get a job , but it was impossible . every time she went for interviews or filled out an application , she felt people looked at her differently . " so she decided she was going to stay home . " that home is now adorned with photographs of @entity6 . one of her last gifts to her mom was perfume , a birthday present she cherishes . " on a daily basis , when i want to think of her , i ca n't tell you how hard it is . it 's too hard to be able to speak . " @entity6 , the middle of three children , shared her room with her younger brother . he played guitar and violin . @entity6 loved the piano , and wanted him to learn to play . just days before she was killed , she picked out a piano for him . he has since purchased it . " when he comes home from work every evening , " the mother said , " he plays the piano and sings in @entity6 's memory . and that 's what keeps us going every evening . " she hopes the people of @entity14 and the world will hear her story -- @entity6 's story -- and never forget her daughter . " i just want to thank you for remembering her . it 's that which stays with me , and it 's her eyes , the look in her eyes in those last moments that had a story to tell that i can never forget , " she said . " @entity6 has made me enormously proud . " it is tradition in @entity14 to give away personal belongings of a loved one after they die . but @entity6 's bed , her makeup stand , her photographs -- everything that was hers -- remains untouched . the reason : @entity6 appeared in her sister 's dream and told her not to part with anything . " i am alive , " @entity6 said .

" @placeholder has made me enormously proud "
