@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- given its long history of warfare , the @entity3 is not squeamish about fatalities in time of war and yet a debate has been ignited by the deaths of 15 @entity3 soldiers in @entity11 over the last few weeks . the question now is whether this profound soul - searching results in a more efficient policy towards the war - torn country . soldiers from the @entity19 carry the coffin of maj @entity21 , killed on patrol in @entity11 in june . the @entity23 became involved in fighting in @entity11 principally because the @entity25 government allowed a non-state actor to carry out acts of terrorism unhindered from within its borders . following the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the @entity31 and the @entity25 's subsequent refusal to extradite members of @entity35 , the @entity31 allied itself to the @entity36 and moved to bring down the @entity25 . following this , the @entity3 and other @entity38 member states stepped forward to help rebuild the country under a @entity42 mandate . while critics of the war have claimed that @entity35 and the @entity25 are separate entities , the links between the two organizations were quite strong ; both share a strict interpretation of @entity49 and a deep antipathy for the @entity23 and modernism more generally . and this affinity has not been played out in the ideological sphere alone : before 9/11 , an elite @entity35 formation called the @entity55 fought alongside the @entity25 in northern @entity11 and provided training and strategic support . this military co-operation is likely to continue today . the level of interconnection is best exemplified by the fact that @entity63 's son was married to @entity65 's daughter in the sort of political match which is meant to forge a blood kinship between the two . the main difference between the two seems to be in the scope of their objectives : while the @entity25 is content with imposing its religious beliefs system on @entity11 , @entity35 has a global agenda of building a new caliphate . @entity77 's statement in 2007 that two - thirds of all terrorist attacks originate in the region reveals not only the severity of the threat but also the fact that many of these plots are hatched over the border in @entity87 . and yet sending @entity3 troops across the border is not an option . the @entity87 military has been engaged in a low - level war in the border regions with elements of the @entity25 since 2001 , when they streamed into the country , chased by @entity31 and @entity36 forces . these elements have successfully taken over the region by emphasizing their @entity100 kinship , the predominant ethnic group in the area , and by killing or intimidating pro-pakistani government tribal elders . they have been able to negotiate one false cease - fire after another with the @entity87 security forces , while at the same time regrouping and repairing their losses . despite the grave threat at its doorstep , @entity109 is unable to invite foreign troops across its border as that would be to admit that it can not protect itself and would induce severe public censure from its own population . the military campaign in @entity120 has a chance to succeed , but will require luck , energy and increased co-ordination of efforts by @entity126 ( @entity126 ) forces . the shift from chasing insurgents to protecting the population offers the potential to gain the allegiance of the local population , but results are unlikely to show themselves for at least six months . if the military part of the campaign is to succeed , there must be positive results in diplomacy , development and security sector reform . the first will be necessary to bring regional actors like @entity145 , @entity87 , and @entity146 to the table , and to buy over local @entity25 commanders and their fighters . in development terms , northern @entity11 is already showing some results , but there is much more to be done in the south where the fighting is the most severe . one key area of development work that can be improved is the removal of the @entity159 cultural bias from the efforts . @entity25 fighters and local resistors are known to be galvanized by development efforts that stress @entity159 values , such as gender and human rights . development efforts should instead focus on cultural - neutral projects such as building a civil service , developing agriculture , building lanes of communication like bridges , roads , and train lines . local and national markets should be developed , for nothing breeds peace like prosperity . we should not be imposing our vision of how society should be , but rather building an @entity11 state that can survive and thrive in the cultural context in which it sits . furthermore , development efforts should be reformed with government agencies taking more of the brunt of the work than private contractors . one of the biggest military obstacles is fighting an insurgency with insufficient forces and equipment . while @entity31 president @entity198 's surge is intended to correct this , the numbers of troops in @entity11 are very low compared to those in @entity201 . a further obstacle is putting an @entity11 face to the fighting . @entity11 is essentially engaged in a civil war , and while the @entity23 must assist and support the current government , it must also build that same government 's capacity to defend itself . indeed , in a country where foreign troops have been a liability , the sooner the @entity11 government in @entity211 is able to do this , the more credibility it will have in the eyes of its own people . while the specter of defeat always looms in public debate , victory remains within grasp . certainly , throwing in the towel would have grave consequences for both the region and for the @entity23 more generally . the first result would be the rejuvenation and galvanization of @entity35 and other similar fundamentalist groups around the world . while victory is possible , it must be carefully defined . already , signs of success are evident in other parts of the country that detract from the gloomy view that we regularly receive from our newspapers and television . according to a @entity3 @entity244 released in april , the number of @entity11 children in school has increased from one million in 2002 to six million in 2008 . healthcare is now available to more than 82 per cent of the population , and 40,000 more children will live beyond their first birthday than in 2002 . a sudden withdrawal by the @entity23 would send the wrong message to both friends and enemies alike in the region and would result in the probable collapse of the infant @entity211 government . furthermore , given that @entity3 losses ( to take one example ) have been lower than those experienced in the @entity260 and the @entity262 campaigns , withdrawal would question the @entity3 ability to stomach losses defending itself and its allies . it would appear to be a long uphill struggle , but the alternatives indicate that this struggle is a necessary one . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity274 and the @entity275 .
