( @entity0 ) -- after enjoying their city 's christmas tree lighting , @entity2 , @entity3 , residents felt a twinge of shock and then a rush of gratitude on saturday when they learned that law officers foiled a plot to set off a bomb in a state the suspect says " nobody ever thinks about . " @entity17 , a 19 - year - old naturalized @entity19 citizen from @entity20 , was seized in connection with a plan to detonate what he believed to be a vehicle bomb at the ceremony on friday night , the @entity16 announced . @entity26 was whisked away by the @entity27 and @entity28 after he attempted to detonate what he believed was an explosives - laden van parked near the tree - lighting ceremony in @entity2 's @entity33 , the @entity16 said in a written statement . but the bomb turned out to be fake , thanks to an undercover operation designed to undermine the plotter . @entity16 spokesman @entity39 said " the materials were not explosive , " and officials said the public was never in danger from the mock device . a resident of @entity46 , @entity3 , and a student at @entity48 , @entity26 -- who now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $ 250,000 fine -- was arrested on suspicion of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction , the @entity27 said . he will make his initial appearance in federal court in @entity2 on monday , the @entity16 said . " it 's very difficult for me to comprehend how a young man who this country has given great opportunities to could waste those opportunities and be willing to commit a horrific crime , " said @entity2 police chief @entity57 . " it is very sad . " @entity2 residents who attended the tree lighting were pleased that law enforcement stopped the attack . @entity69 said she did n't know about the investigation until she returned home from the tree lighting . " it does make me feel better that the @entity27 was on the ball in this case and doing some actual work , rather than pretending to look out for us and trying to make themselves look good , " the @entity2 resident told @entity0 . " why would anyone mess with @entity2 ? it 's such a sweet little town . obviously somebody wanted to . " but @entity84 , @entity19 attorney for the district of @entity3 , said in a statement that this " defendant 's chilling determination is a stark reminder that there are people -- even here in @entity3 -- who are determined to kill @entity19 . " @entity94 , special agent in charge of the @entity27 in @entity3 , called the threat " very real . " " our investigation shows that @entity26 was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale , " @entity94 said . " at the same time , i want to reassure the people of this community that , at every turn , we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack . " on his blog , @entity2 mayor @entity107 lauded a " smart " investigation by local , state and federal agencies that led to the capture of someone " bent on mass destruction and murder in the city . " the arrest was the culmination of a long - term undercover operation during which @entity26 had been monitored closely as the alleged plot developed , the @entity16 said . according to an arrest warrant affidavit written by an @entity27 special agent , @entity26 was in e-mail communication in august 2009 with a person believed to be involved in terrorist activities . in december , that person was " located in the northwest frontier province of @entity128 , " the affidavit states . the two communicated regularly , the affidavit states , and " using coded language , they discussed the possibility of @entity26 traveling to @entity128 to prepare for violent jihad . " @entity26 attempted to contact another associate who he thought would help facilitate his travel overseas , the affidavit states , but " because @entity26 used the wrong e-mail address in his efforts to contact [ the second associate ] , he never successfully contacted him to arrange travel . " an undercover @entity27 employee contacted @entity26 in june under the guise of being affiliated with the associate who was in @entity128 , according to the affidavit . @entity26 met with the undercover operative on july 30 in @entity2 . @entity26 allegedly told the undercover operative that he had written articles that were published in @entity150 , an online magazine that advocated violent jihad . " @entity26 also indicated that he wanted to become ' operational , ' " the @entity16 said . " asked what he meant by ' operational , ' @entity26 stated that he wanted to put an ' explosion ' together , but needed help . " at a meeting in august , the @entity16 said , @entity26 allegedly told undercover @entity27 operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15 . according to the affidavit , @entity26 then told undercover operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb : the annual @entity162 lighting ceremony in @entity2 's @entity33 . authorities said an @entity27 operative pointed out that lots of children would be at such an event , but @entity26 said he was looking for a " huge mass that will ... be attacked in their own element with their families celebrating the holidays . " officials said @entity26 also stated , " ... it 's in @entity3 ; and @entity3 like you know , nobody ever thinks about it . " according to the affidavit , @entity26 and the undercover @entity27 operatives traveled to a remote area in @entity181 , @entity3 , on november 4 and detonated a bomb hidden in a backpack as a test . during the drive back to @entity46 , the agents asked @entity26 about whether he could look at the bodies of those who would be killed in the upcoming attack in @entity2 , the @entity16 said . @entity26 replied , " i want whoever is attending that event to leave , to leave either dead or injured , " according to the affidavit . on friday , @entity26 met one of the @entity27 operatives at a predetermined location , the affidavit states . @entity26 dialed a number " in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate the device . " @entity26 allegedly dialed the number again before he was taken custody . @entity2 police sgt. @entity202 , who said police officers got involved in the investigation several months ago , said the arrest went down several blocks from the tree lighting . " there were a lot of eyes normally not here that were here last night to make sure this operation went off successfully , " @entity209 told @entity0 affiliate @entity210 on saturday . " there was no danger to the public last night . " muslims in the @entity2 area decried the alleged plot at a saturday news conference . " we condemn strongly any act of violence that would target innocent people , " said @entity224 of the @entity3 @entity226 chaplain organization . " we condemn the alleged actions that were thwarted last night . " another leader thanked local police and the community for outreach to and protection of area mosques . " things like this really set us back , " said @entity237 of @entity238 in @entity239 . @entity242 of @entity243 spent saturday handing out information to @entity2 passers - by . " we need to show the world that @entity226 can co-exist with the rest of the world peacefully , " he said . @entity0 's @entity249 and @entity0 's @entity250 contributed to this report .
