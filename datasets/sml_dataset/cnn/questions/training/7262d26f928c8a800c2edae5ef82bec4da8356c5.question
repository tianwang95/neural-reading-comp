@entity1 , @entity0 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 would be lost without them -- those madcap gadgets merging two technologies that help him beat the bad guys and save the planet . the underwater watch with a built - in @entity14 , for example ; or the car that doubles as a submarine ; or the exploding bagpipes and missile - launching wheelchair . an artist 's impression of what a @entity18 might look like now a @entity21 company has taken a leaf out of 007 's book and developed a similarly unlikely " combination " technology . the " villain " in this case is not a psychotic , cat - stroking megalomaniac , but something both more prosaic and , potentially , more threatening -- global warming : in particular , how to meet the world 's energy needs without swamping the planet with clouds of atmosphere - clogging pollutants . and the madcap gadget that might just provide a solution ? a helicopter that doubles as a wind turbine . or , to give it its technical name , a @entity18 ( @entity18 ) . the brainchild of @entity44 engineering specialist professor @entity43 , the @entity18 is being developed by @entity46 - based company @entity45 . code - cracker turned turbine enthusiast the latter is headed by @entity50 , who started his career cracking @entity53 military ciphers during @entity54 , and went on to create the @entity56 numeric font that appears on credit cards around the world . @entity50 has long been convinced of the need for a new global energy source to reduce reliance on carbon - emitting fossil fuels . for the last two decades his attention has focused on the electricity - generating potential of high - altitude winds , and when he learnt of professor @entity43 ' prototype " gyromill " -- a flying wind turbine that the @entity44 had been developing since 1979 -- he decided it offered the best model for realizing that potential . the two men started working together in 2002 , and the @entity18 is the result . high - altitude winds the guiding principle of the @entity18 is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground , especially in the two major jet streams - the @entity81 and the @entity82 - that exist in each hemisphere ( at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively ) . a turbine at great height , so the theory goes , can generate far more power than a similar turbine at or near ground level . it has been estimated that capturing just one percent of the available energy of these high altitude winds would meet the electricity needs of the entire planet . " @entity97 winds a few miles above the mid latitudes of the @entity100 and @entity101 hemispheres are far stronger and more persistent than the winds just above us , " @entity50 told @entity2 . " this results in potentially being able to generate electricity for over eighty percent of the time , as opposed to thirty percent of the time at ground - based wind turbine sites . " the largest ground - based wind turbines currently produce about five megawatts each . we expect typical @entity111 to produce about 20 megawatts each . " helicopter technology but how do we get a working turbine up to the necessary height -- at least 15,000 ft ( 4600 meters ) above the earth 's surface ? that 's where helicopter technology comes in . taking the form of a giant h - shaped frame , the prototype @entity18 has four huge blades at the four points of the @entity125 , each blade 10.7 meters ( 35 feet ) in diameter . these act like the rotors of a helicopter , lifting the @entity111 to the required height . once in place , the blades not only keep the @entity18 air - born , providing lift like the surface area of a kite , but also act as turbines , turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity , which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable . an in - built gps ( @entity142 ) uses satellite technology to ensure that the @entity18 always remains in the same place , both vertically and horizontally . according to @entity50 , development is already at an advanced stage . " professor @entity43 demonstrated a @entity18 in @entity44 at an altitude of sixty feet over a decade ago , " he told @entity2 . @entity21 demonstration in three years " we expect to make a demonstration in the @entity21 less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds . in four years i would expect this sort of technology to be in active use . " as with ground - based wind farms , @entity50 envisages whole " sky - farms " of @entity160 hovering above the earth in restricted airspace . forty - three such @entity18 " arrays " -- each comprising 600 @entity111 -- would , he estimates , generate sufficient electricity to power the whole of the @entity21 " our calculations show that by reserving less than one four - hundredth of @entity21 air space , located at relatively remote locations not on airway routes , all of @entity21 's electrical energy needs could be met , " he says . " that is considerably less airspace than is already restricted for other purposes , primarily military . " not only would the @entity111 provide clean energy -- the feedback from environmental groups , according to @entity50 , has been overwhelmingly positive -- but at less cost than conventional electricity generation . while each @entity18 would cost an estimated $ 2,260,000 to build , maintain and support , arrays of @entity184 would , in the long term , prove extremely cost effective , generating electricity at about 2 cents per kilowatt hour , as opposed to the 3 - 5 cents of conventional generating methods . there are risks , of course . even in restricted airspace there is the possibility of collision with aircraft that unwittingly -- or illegally -- stray into that airspace . likewise , despite numerous design features aimed at ensuring the stability of the air - born @entity18 , the possibility of the structure malfunctioning and plummeting to earth can not be excluded . crashes " inevitable " " inevitably crashes will occur , " the @entity45 web site acknowledges , " just as airplane crashes occur . " statistically , however , @entity160 should be just as reliable as commercial airliners , whose safety records are incredibly good . " and @entity160 do n't take off or land at airports teeming with people in and around them . " @entity50 and @entity43 are not the only people to have considered harnessing the power of high - altitude winds . @entity213 , a @entity214 company , have been developing a helium - filled , medium altitude wind generator , while in the @entity216 has been exploring similar ground using kite technology . @entity45 's @entity18 , however , is at the forefront of the field , with the @entity21 government showing considerable interest in the prototype helicopter - cum - wind - turbine . whether it will provide a definitive solution to the world 's ever - increasing energy needs remains to be seen . with the effects of global warming and climate change becoming increasingly acute , however , a technology that might once have been dismissed as no more than a @entity3 fantasy now looks as if it could have a serious role to play . they might not be quite as sexy as your average @entity3 adventure , but flying wind turbines could end up generating a lot more heat than 007 and @entity240 ever did . ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... are @entity241 a crackpot idea ? or could they help save the planet ? share your views and read others ' thoughts in the @entity248 forum .
