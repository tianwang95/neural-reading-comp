editor 's note : @entity2 is executive editorial director for @entity3 and @entity3 , and co-host of " @entity5 , " heard on more than 300 radio stations . in the 1980s he served as editor of @entity8 . @entity9 is the author of " the @entity11 to hybrid and @entity12 , " published recently by @entity13 . @entity14 says bankruptcy would drive car buyers away from @entity17 and imperil suppliers . ( @entity19 ) -- the events of the past week have been unprecedented in the auto industry and in the annals of @entity24 business . as the events have unfolded , there is the strong implication from the administration 's automotive task force that chapter 11 bankruptcy , followed by restructuring and " cleansing " of @entity17 ' balance sheet , is a potential scenario in the ongoing efforts to keep the giant automaker alive . @entity17 's new chief executive , @entity37 , acknowledged as much on @entity19 sunday . " you ca n't rule options off the table . so you basically say we will spend time to try to get it [ done ] outside of bankruptcy . but if we ca n't , we 're not going to compromise our goals . we 're going to get it done inside our bankruptcy . our preferred approach is still to do it outside , but you ca n't rule out going in . " over the past few weeks pundits of all stripes have appeared on financial news networks suggesting that entering chapter 11 is @entity17 's only way to future viability . " get on with it , " they say , and save us the agony . it is the only way , they argue , @entity17 can get relief from its immediate cash - flow issues , tear up or substantially modify its union contracts , dump unnecessary brands , close plants and " right - size " its operations . but those pundits who propose chapter 11 fail to acknowledge that @entity17 is a consumer - facing company whose success or failure is in the hands of millions of average @entity24 . this group will decide to buy or not buy @entity17 vehicles based on what they know , hear and even feel about @entity17 's future . as talk of imminent bankruptcy swirls in the press , the news they hear about @entity17 certainly is not reassuring , as they consider which brand to buy . how does that manifest itself in the car - buying public ? we at @entity3 asked 500 potential new - vehicle buyers a string of related questions that yield answers to that multi-billion dollar question . their response is telling . asked " how likely would you be to buy a car from @entity17 if they were to go bankrupt , " 42.1 percent of new - vehicle buyers said they were either " not at all likely " or " not very likely " to do so . even with a warranty guarantee from the federal government , consumers are not very enthusiastic about considering a @entity17 purchase . such a guarantee only moves the needle about three percentage points with 39.8 percent saying they were either " not at all likely " or " not very likely " to purchase a @entity17 vehicle in such a situation . asked , " how likely would you be to buy a car from @entity17 if they were allowed to keep operating but had to renegotiate their contracts and agreements with suppliers and laborers ? " the responses changed . given that scenario , only 31.6 percent of new - vehicle buyers said they were either " not at all likely " or " not very likely " to purchase a @entity17 vehicle , and they were out - numbered by the 41.5 percent who said they were either " very likely " or " extremely likely " to do so . while one must keep in mind that consumers do n't always do what they say they are going to do , the import of this is clear : @entity129 puts a damper on consumer confidence and vehicle demand . there are other reasons to question the wisdom of a @entity137 filing as well . beyond its potentially chilling effect on consumer demand , there is a domino effect on the supplier community . many @entity17 vendors have operated for years on ever - declining , razor - thin margins and are heavily dependent on @entity17 for cash - flow . if that cash - flow ceases for even a relatively short period of time it could well send many of those suppliers into bankruptcy and force others simply to close their doors . the likely bankruptcies of supplier companies would have a ripple effect through the entire @entity24 vehicle manufacturing industry , causing hardships for the healthier companies as well . further , while a " quick - cleanse " bankruptcy is contemplated , it is very difficult to imagine that the chapter 11 bankruptcy of one of the largest industrial companies in the world would not take a year or more to unravel , rather than weeks or months . and if @entity17 languishes in bankruptcy it is hard to imagine consumers flocking to buy its new vehicles . nor is it likely the government would subsidize those operations through the potentially lengthy proceedings . the implications of the pronouncements made by president @entity177 and the auto industry task force indicate clearly that they believe a figurative hammer is needed to move the stakeholders -- the @entity181 , pensioners , bondholders and creditors -- to accept settlements that are , at best , unpalatable to them . the threat of bankruptcy is that hammer . but the question should be asked : is the hammer the task force is holding over the head of the @entity17 stakeholders in an effort to get concessions , the same hammer that will drive away consumers and require the federal government to make larger and larger cash infusions or see @entity17 founder ? so while some toss out the idea of a chapter 11 bankruptcy as being a magic elixir for @entity17 , which has found itself trapped in an unprecedented credit crunch and a sharp recession , we have to believe that bankruptcy is a bankrupt idea . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .

he says bankruptcy is being used as a hammer for @placeholder to get concessions
