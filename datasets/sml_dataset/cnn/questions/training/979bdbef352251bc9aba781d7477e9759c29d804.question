@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- a government official at the center of lavish spending at a @entity6 conference claimed his fifth amendment rights against testifying at a congressional hearing monday , while his former boss said she mourned her departure from public service over the controversy . @entity13 , the @entity14 official who organized the 2010 conference that cost $ 800,000 , repeatedly refused to answer questions , saying more than five times : " i respectfully decline to answer any questions here today based on my @entity20 constitutional privileges . " rep. @entity21 , the @entity22 chairman of the @entity23 , then excused @entity13 and proceeded with the hearing on what he described as an unacceptable waste of taxpayer money . " we 're here today to get answers to questions that should have been asked and answered a long , long , long time ago , " @entity21 said in his opening remarks , adding that the controversy raised " serious questions in the minds of the @entity33 people about how government is using their tax dollars . " @entity21 also injected politics into his comments , saying the situation should raise questions in the minds of people about whether " government and its reach should be expanded , " a common @entity22 criticism of @entity47 . the controversy involving a normally obscure federal agency has become politically toxic after reports and video clips of the lavish 2010 conference in @entity6 were released . the revelation has prompted taxpayer indignation , embarrassed the administration and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the @entity14 , which acts as a real estate agency for the federal government . particular questions raised by @entity21 included why it took 11 months for the results of an inspector general 's investigation to become public , and why a former congressional aide to president @entity66 remained in his top job at @entity14 when he likely knew of the wrongdoing -- or should have . in later tough questioning of that official , @entity14 chief of staff @entity69 , @entity21 determined that a lawyer in the @entity75 counsel 's office knew of the ongoing investigation of the @entity14 in the middle of 2011 , nine months before the earliest time acknowledged to date by the administration . however , @entity69 later issued a statement to clarify his testimony to the committee , saying : " i only mentioned in passing the existence of an @entity85 ( inspector general ) investigation as i bumped into a @entity75 staffer that i regularly worked with on @entity14 issues . this was in late may or june of 2011 . " committee members from both parties expressed outrage monday over the @entity14 's excessive spending , contracting violations and other abuses cited by the inspector general 's report . rep. @entity98 of @entity99 , the ranking @entity100 on the panel , called the @entity14 behavior " indefensible and intolerable , " taking aim at @entity104 , a @entity14 regional commissioner for @entity14 who organized the @entity6 conference . " in one e-mail , " @entity98 began , " mr. @entity13 invited personal friends to the conference , writing , and i quote -- and this is simply incredible -- quote : ' we 'll get you guys a room near us , and we 'll pick up the room tab . could be a blast . ' end of quote . he then went on and wrote this -- ' i know i 'm bad , but as @entity121 and i often say , why not enjoy it while we have it and while we can . @entity125 n't gon na last forever . ' end of quote . well , mr. @entity13 it stops now . " in her opening statement , former @entity14 administrator @entity128 said she found a badly managed @entity14 when she took over in 2010 after more than two years of interim leadership . she added that the @entity132 conference at the heart of the problem had become a " raucous , extravagant , arrogant , self - congratulatory event that ultimately belittled federal workers . " when she received a draft of the final inspector general 's report outlining the abuses , @entity128 said , she started thinking immediately she might have to resign . her final decision to step down came " three or four days " before the final report was released in march because she wanted to send a message to the @entity33 people that " this was unacceptable , it was appalling and not the norm , " said @entity128 , who had a long career in public service . " i will mourn for the rest of my life the loss of my appointment , " @entity128 said of her resignation . @entity128 stepped down nearly two weeks ago as the @entity66 administration revealed details of the @entity158 convention at a @entity6 casino . videos then surfaced of @entity161 , a deputy commissioner of the @entity14 , an arm of the @entity14 , appearing to mock congressional oversight . in it , he gave a talent show award to an employee whose video featured a rap about spending too much and joking about avoiding investigation . additional videos also came out , including one that seemed to make fun of president @entity66 , as well as a fake red carpet ceremony with @entity13 , a deputy @entity14 commissioner , boasting that his goal was to make the @entity6 conference he helped organize " over the top . " details also emerged of an employee incentive program that violated limits on awards or gifts . @entity128 , @entity161 , @entity69 and @entity13 were all witnesses at monday 's hearing , along with @entity14 inspector general @entity187 , who wrote the report on @entity14 spending that set off the public controversy . @entity21 said @entity13 was the only witness who required a subpoena . @entity13 also was the only one who refused to answer questions under constitutional protections against self - incrimination . committee members took the witnesses to task over the violations of government regulations and policies cited by @entity187 's report . in particular , conservative @entity22 members repeatedly listed the excesses -- more than $ 6,000 for commemorative coins for conference attendees , $ 75,000 for a team - building exercise to construct 24 bicycles then given to underprivileged children , the hiring of a mind reader as entertainment -- as well as bypassing a staff event planner to pay outsiders to prepare the conference and repeated " scouting visits " to @entity6 by officials and family members . " i want indictments , " rep. @entity218 , @entity220 - @entity219 , said to @entity187 . " that 's a great way to get people 's attention . not a memo , not a report . an indictment . " working for the government " is a sacred trust , which you have blown , " @entity218 said to the @entity14 officials . he lamented the culture of waste and extravagance , saying of the team - building exercise that " i hate that you robbed yourself of the satisfaction of knowing what it feels like yourself instead of spending somebody else 's money to do it . " the hearing included several harsh exchanges , including when @entity21 questioned @entity69 , a former staffer for @entity66 in the @entity243 , about when he first told anyone in the @entity75 of the investigation of @entity14 . in a long back - and - forth , @entity21 tried to narrow @entity247 's responses to a specific date and person . " i communicated to the appropriate people , " @entity69 initially answered , then acknowledged he spoke to the @entity75 as part of his regular dealings . asked when he first told anyone at the @entity75 about the investigation , @entity69 eventually said it was within a few weeks after @entity14 officials were first notified by the inspector general of a problem in may 2011 . @entity21 then asked who he told , and @entity69 twice said it was an unnamed person in the @entity75 counsel 's office before @entity21 insisted : " what 's the name ? " only then did @entity69 answer the person was @entity265 . @entity75 salary disclosures for 2011 list a @entity268 as a deputy assistant to the president and deputy counsel to the president . previously , a senior administration official told @entity1 that the @entity75 was notified by @entity14 about the final inspector general 's report shortly before it was released last month , more than nine months after @entity69 said he told @entity265 about the ongoing investigation . @entity21 acknowledged that over-the - top @entity14 spending existed during the preceding @entity279 administration , though he disputes figures released by @entity66 officials that show a 102 % increase from 2006 to 2008 . however , information provided by his staff on monday showed the increase from 2006 to 2008 approached that figure . " wasteful spending is a problem that transcends multiple administrations , " he said , adding that it was up to the current administration to halt it now . @entity1 's @entity293 contributed to this report .
