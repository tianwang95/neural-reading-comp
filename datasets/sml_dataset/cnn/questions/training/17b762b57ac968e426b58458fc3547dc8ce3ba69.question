( @entity0 ) -- he 's created some of the world 's highest - earning stage shows , so it 's only fitting that @entity6 will be in the limelight on the day of the planet 's most expensive horse race . the man behind hits such as " cats , " " @entity14 " and " @entity15 " also has a big interest in the sport of kings , through which he met his third wife @entity19 -- a former equestrian rider who competed alongside @entity21 's @entity20 . married since 1991 , they have owned a stud on a 5,000 - acre site in @entity25 ( setting for the 1970s novel and film of the same name ) which has produced a series of winners . the latest is @entity31 -- a filly who has already amassed earnings in excess of $ 1.5 million and boasts her own @entity37 page with more than 1,000 followers . the name is befitting of her owners -- the fugue being the most complex polyphonic musical form , involving imitation -- while the literal translation of " to chase " is considerably more apt for the animal . " i 've ridden a lot of good horses in a relatively short period of time and she 's right up there with the very best . she 's a superstar , " says jockey @entity54 , who rode her for the first time less than two weeks ago . @entity31 will not be lining up in the showpiece $ 10 million @entity59 , which is run on artificial turf , but will compete earlier saturday in the @entity61 -- which has a relatively paltry $ 5 million on offer and is held on a traditional surface . it is the richest day of thoroughbred racing on the planet , with $ 27.25 million up for grabs in total . " she 's a filly whose best form , her only form , is on the turf , " says trainer @entity68 . " had it been the end of the season we might have thought differently . " but this is her very first race of the year so we felt it best as a filly to run her on the surface she knows and likes best even if the distance is slightly shorter than she might normally run over . " last year @entity31 won the @entity85 race and came second at the prestigious @entity86 in the @entity87 she is the bookmakers ' favorite this weekend -- though punters at the $ 1 billion @entity91 will not be able to bet on the outcome due to @entity94 's rules against gambling . " she 's a talented filly and she 's won some lovely races but a couple of times she 's been unlucky and not had the rub of the green , " says @entity68 , a former economist who -- with @entity96 -- makes up an unconventional team behind @entity31 . if @entity106 -- who met the theater impresario through his horse - loving neighbors in the southern @entity110 -- is the mastermind behind the stud since its inception in 1992 , then @entity68 is the former " wayward son " who has rediscovered his true path in life . " i met them some years ago training close to where they live , " he says . " obviously for @entity6 the horses would n't be his primary focus but he and his wife are great horse people . " the son of a famous trainer -- @entity125 , who won the 1966 @entity126 a year before he died -- he initially veered away from following in his footsteps . he studied economics at @entity129 where he met his lawyer wife @entity130 -- now chairwoman of the @entity21 's @entity132 -- and excelled in the discus and javelin rather than pursuing any equine sporting feats . " i tried to forge my own path away from racing , which was why i went into land management initially , " @entity68 recalls . " at the time , we were in a massive recession and it was ( @entity21 prime minister ) @entity142 's three - day week ( to conserve the nation 's energy supplies ) , so going abroad made sense . " he went as far as @entity146 , but never lost his passion for horse racing . " i think it was just instilled in me , " @entity68 says . " when working in @entity150 i 'd still be up at 4:30 in the morning with the horses there before going to work in an architect 's office . " returning to racing as an assistant trainer , he moved to @entity155 in the 1970s before attaining an @entity87 licence at the end of the decade . his big break came in 1983 with @entity160 , a horse named after the celebrated establishment in @entity165 's 1960 movie @entity163 , when it won the prestigious @entity166 -- @entity155 's richest race for older horses . " it was an apt name , " recalls @entity68 . " he was quite a character and he had a vicious side to him . but that 's not how he got his name -- i believe the owners , the @entity176 , were simply big fans of @entity165 's movies . " for me in @entity146 , that was my first big win but it was easier to get started out there than back in the @entity21 . it was a golden era of racing there . everyone needs a break in life and that was mine . " in 1989 he returned to the @entity21 where he has been based ever since at a series of different stables , with more than 2,000 race wins including the @entity126 , the @entity190 , the @entity191 , the @entity192 twice and the @entity193 , and being crowned @entity21 flat racing champion trainer in 2012 . more recently , many of those successes have come with @entity96 on board . many eyebrows were raised when @entity68 hired the then 21 - year - old novice to become his stable jockey in 2010 . much of the horse - racing fraternity said he was mad , but the results have proved otherwise . photos : bubbles and cuddles as @entity94 parties @entity96 's passage into racing is not the most oft taken . born in @entity209 -- not renowned for being a breeding ground for top jockeys -- he had some pedigree ; his @entity215 father @entity214 was an eight - time @entity216 champion jockey while his @entity218 mother @entity217 was a dressage rider and showjumper . " we have a very close relationship as a family and i was always surrounded by horses , " he recalls . " @entity224 was a very successful jockey while my @entity225 had a lot of wins as an amateur jockey too while being an equestrian rider . " with limited opportunities in @entity209 , @entity54 decided to move to the @entity21 when he was 16 to start an apprenticeship . " thankfully , i never really looked back as i got good breaks in life , " he says . " you have to have ability but you need those breaks too . i got those -- a good bit of luck really . " the biggest break of all was the tie - up with @entity68 , who he admits " took a punt on me . " that almost immediately paid off at the same @entity91 where he hopes to shine on saturday , with victory on @entity245 in the 2010 @entity193 -- a similar caliber @entity85 race to the @entity61 . " this race is not going to be easy by any stretch of the imagination , " @entity54 says . " she 's a classy filly and has proved she can take on the best in the world . i 'm not going to say she 'll win , as so many things can happen , but she 's got a great chance . " all eyes will be on the race at @entity91 -- the day before @entity68 turns 63 . the veteran trainer will be hoping @entity31 makes it a birthday to remember .

her trainer @entity68 got his first big break through a horse called @placeholder
