@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the man suspected of shooting and killing two @entity6 @entity5 servicemen in @entity1 was seeking revenge because of @entity6 military operations in @entity9 , according to a warrant issued on friday for the suspect . the suspect , @entity12 , is a recently radicalized @entity13 who seems to have been influenced by local radical @entity16 websites , according to @entity1 authorities . prosecutors say @entity12 shot and killed two @entity6 servicemen and wounded two others in the attack wednesday on a @entity6 military bus at @entity23 . the arrest warrant for @entity12 lists two accusations of murder , three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm . the 21 - year - old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before , which he claimed showed @entity6 soldiers raping @entity13 women , according to a @entity1 intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect 's interrogation . the suspect confessed to the shooting , and said that he acted alone with no helpers , the @entity1 intelligence official said thursday . he was friends on @entity44 with several pro-al @entity46 extremists from a group based in @entity48 , @entity1 , that is known to @entity1 intelligence officials , according to the official . he also had links to an @entity16 preacher named @entity53 and someone named @entity55 , who was arrested about two months ago in @entity9 , according to a @entity6 official with direct knowledge of the investigation . the gunman was a postal worker at the airport , but worked outside the secure area . the @entity6 official said @entity12 did n't appear to punch into work wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand , helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain - clothes security that typically patrol the @entity0 airport . another @entity6 official on thursday said that @entity12 was " not on the radar screen " of @entity6 authorities prior to the attack . the suspect is from @entity72 , a town in northern @entity73 , that country 's interior minister , @entity74 , told @entity2 . he cited the @entity76 in @entity77 as his source . the @entity6 official with knowledge of the probe said @entity12 was a 1 - year - old toddler when he moved to @entity1 , and that authorities believe @entity12 's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the @entity84 crackdown on ethnic @entity85 . he has passports from both @entity1 and @entity89 , the latter of which was issued prior to @entity73 's declaration of independence from @entity84 in 2008 , @entity74 said . @entity12 told interrogators that he lived with his family in high - rise public housing in a poor area of @entity0 , the @entity1 intelligence official said . he said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there . he said his father was very strict and harsh with him , according to the official . on wednesday , he allegedly approached a bus , which was parked outside @entity105 and was clearly marked as a @entity6 military vehicle , @entity1 police said after the shooting . according to the warrant , @entity12 asked a recruit where he was being deployed . the airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to @entity9 . @entity12 then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun . the suspect then entered the bus , screamed " @entity119 , " and opened fire , killing the driver , the warrant says . @entity12 then shot two other passengers , wounding one in the head and the other in the chest , the warrant says . the suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed , it says . the suspect fled then fled into the terminal , where he was taken into custody by @entity1 federal police , according to the warrant . the suspect used a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased , @entity133 said . one of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at @entity138 , and the second was part of a security forces team based in the @entity142 , an @entity5 spokesman said . the bus was occupied by 15 members of a security forces team that was on its way to @entity138 in @entity1 before deploying to @entity9 , the spokesman said . @entity148 was one of those killed , his grandfather , @entity147 , told @entity2 . it 's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team . a statement from his family described @entity147 as a hockey player and " @entity159 brat " with especially strong roots in @entity161 in @entity162 who joined the @entity5 in 2009 after a year at @entity164 . the @entity165 on thursday identified the other victim as senior airman @entity167 , 25 , of @entity168 , @entity169 . he had been assigned to the 48th @entity170 based out of the @entity172 air base in @entity173 . the two wounded airmen were in a @entity0 hospital , one in critical condition and the other in serious condition , an @entity5 spokesman said . president @entity180 told reporters wednesday he was " saddened and outraged " by the attack . " we will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place , " he said . @entity1 chancellor @entity187 said how upset she was by the incident , expressed her condolences to the troops ' families and stressed that @entity1 will " do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened . " @entity195 agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred , said @entity198 , a former @entity195 assistant director and @entity2 contributor . the @entity195 's main office in @entity1 is in the capital @entity201 , he said , but it has a sub-office in @entity0 . the offense is a federal crime both in the @entity6 and in @entity1 , he said , and could be prosecuted in either location , although that will be determined later . however , the investigation will meet @entity6 constitutional standards , he said . authorities will be investigating the suspect 's background and associates , likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records , @entity198 said . @entity2 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity2 investigative journalist @entity220 contributed to this report .

the suspect , @entity12 , left @entity73 at age 1 and was an ethnic @entity85 , a @placeholder official says
