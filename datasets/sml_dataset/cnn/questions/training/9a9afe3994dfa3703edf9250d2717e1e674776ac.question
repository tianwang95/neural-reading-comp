@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- how much would you pay to get your child into an @entity5 university ? for @entity7 and @entity8 , it seems the sky was the limit . in 2007 , the @entity0 couple enlisted harvard - lecturer - turned - admissions - consultant @entity12 to steer their two sons through elite @entity17 boarding schools into a top - ranked university -- preferably @entity19 . for a monthly $ 4000 fee per child , their " total education management " package included extensive admissions counseling , arranging homestays , private tutoring , and extra-curricular activities , whereby @entity12 and his team functioned as " parents away from parents " for their sons . the @entity34 later switched to a retainer of $ 1 million per child . but in 2010 , before their sons applied to university , the @entity34 sued @entity12 to recover their $ 2 million retainer , alleging fraud , breach of conduct , and unjust enrichment , according to court documents . @entity12 denied any wrongdoing to @entity1 , alleging the @entity34 sought to end their relationship after " poaching " one of his contract staff as a cheaper replacement . admissions consultants say the @entity52 case is an anomaly , both in terms of the amount the couple paid and the assurances @entity12 allegedly made . but it highlights the strong appetite among the wealthiest in @entity0 for elite @entity17 education and the nebulous role that a burgeoning flock of consultants play in the process . @entity0 is the 16th leading place of origin for international enrollment at @entity17 colleges and universities , according to the @entity70 , with its students increasing 1.3 % to 8,136 in the 2010 - 11 academic year . " when people are looking at the @entity17 education system , it 's seen as one of the best in the world , " said @entity72 , an @entity17 who moved to @entity0 in 2005 and quickly identified admissions consulting as a business opportunity . " everybody was talking about top @entity17 colleges -- it was clearly something that was very important to a lot of people , something that was very well - respected , " she added . " especially when you send your children to the @entity17 , you want them to develop critical and creative thinking skills , " she explained , adding that an @entity17 degree is seen by @entity91 as providing " increased opportunities for their children throughout the rest of their lives . " since setting up her firm , @entity72 said a wealth of new or expanded consultancies have cropped up , particularly ones offering comprehensive packages that not only encompass preparation for the standardized admission exam ( @entity103 ) , but also services like tutoring and debate training . some consultancies , such as @entity108 , begin grooming students as early as in eighth grade ( around ages 13 - 14 ) , giving them " a well - built resume that does n't spike in their final year ( before entering university ) , " said @entity108 's founder , @entity115 . " before as an admissions consultant ( in @entity0 ) , you could work part - time and do it out of @entity118 . now most companies have a full - time staff , they have their own offices , and it 's all - year - round support , " @entity115 said , citing his annual client base as growing from four to up to 40 students . affluent @entity125 families view elite @entity17 education as a form of conspicuous consumption and are willing to " throw money at it , " @entity12 said , describing his clients as " the 1 % of the 1 % . " case in point : @entity52 is a member of the family that owns the @entity136 jewelry empire in @entity0 . most parents who seek @entity108 's services are investment bank partners , lawyers , or entrepreneurs , @entity115 said , quoting fees of $ 6,450 - $ 19,350 for a one - year package . @entity72 said her clients have varying income backgrounds , but they all prioritize their children 's education . she quoted her average yearly fee as $ 3,225 - $ 7,750 . while international students may genuinely need help navigating the unfamiliar terrain of the @entity17 application process , the @entity52 case raises the specter of the unscrupulous consultant -- in an unregulated profession . the @entity17 - based @entity157 ( @entity157 ) denounced @entity12 as a " con artist , " describing the monthly $ 8,000 fees for the two @entity34 sons as approximating " what should be a single fee , over a multi-year period , to work comprehensively with a student . " it pointed out that @entity12 's communications with the @entity34 " were all about ' getting in , ' " saying that success should be measured by a student 's university experience , not admission . " the thing i worry about consultants is they can do a lot of work in terms of writing essays and it 's unethical , " said @entity170 , a lecturer at @entity171 in @entity172 who specializes in higher education admissions policy . " but it 's good if they 're helping students find a good fit and what they want in a college , rather than how can we game the system to get into the school we want ? " @entity19 was even less enthusiastic . " while it is certainly possible that in individual cases an admissions consultant can be helpful to an applicant , we have encountered no evidence to indicate that is the case generally , " said spokesperson @entity191 . @entity72 said competition for places at top schools had become fierce . " students , who ten years ago would have gotten into @entity19 , @entity203 , and @entity204 , might not be able to now , " she said . to gain an edge , some wealthy applicants offer donations to boarding schools and universities , consultants said . in their lawsuit , the @entity34 claim @entity12 convinced them that elite schools unofficially expected donations from foreign applicants . through their lawyer , the @entity34 declined to comment on the pending case . while donations are " not an absolute requirement , " @entity12 told @entity1 , they are a " common practice " that can pivotally influence boarding school and university admissions . e-mails submitted to the court reveal extensive discussions between @entity226 and @entity227 boarding school officials over the 2007 - 08 academic year , regarding the wealth and likelihood of donations from the @entity34 . boarding schools conduct " intensive screening of applicants so they can assess who has the potential to donate money once the child is admitted , and then the development directors work feverishly to court the constituencies , " @entity12 said . @entity227 denied conducting " financial screenings of any applicants except for those applying for financial aid , although on occasion we become aware of a prospective family 's history of or capacity for philanthropic support , " according to its director of development , @entity249 , who exchanged numerous e-mails with @entity12 . @entity12 said he also personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to @entity227 to " advance the prospects " of the @entity52 sons -- as well as his future clients . he added that these donations were factored into his $ 250,000 " extraordinary admission fee " charged in successful cases that required extensive lobbying . while @entity249 confirmed that @entity12 made several gifts to the school , he said they were unrelated to the @entity52 sons , adding that " no donation or promise of donation was made to @entity227 by the @entity34 or mr. @entity12 on their behalf , as part of the admission process . " he said donations were neither common nor pivotally influential in admissions decisions . in march 2008 , the @entity52 sons were admitted to @entity227 -- a decision @entity270 said was merited , given their " academic records , extracurricular involvement , and leadership potential . " @entity12 attributed their admission to his donations , saying that the sons ' secondary school admission test scores ( @entity279 ) were weak . he said he had stopped working with the @entity52 sons before they applied to university . @entity12 said his services can also include brokering introduction meetings between potential donors from @entity284 and development officials at @entity17 universities , adding that schools welcomed these introductions as a way of fielding multitudes of donation requests . in his view , " money is money , whether it 's coming from a random family in @entity0 or a fifth - generation @entity294 applying to @entity204 . " he added that donations have to be presented " in a way that does n't look like quid pro quo . " consultant @entity72 disagreed , saying she has heard of donations making a significant difference in admissions decisions only in " development cases , " which involve families with multiple generations of alumni that have made significant donations over the years . @entity19 declined to comment on whether donations influence admissions decisions . the @entity157 said " no educational consultant will act as a middleman for donations to a school , " adding that consultants " will put the family directly in touch with a university 's development office and donations would be made directly . " but the appetite among @entity0 's elite for getting their offspring into top universities is unlikely to fade . " the way to differentiate yourself is " that one line on your resume that says what university you came from , " @entity108 's @entity115 said . " that 's one of the few elements that sticks with you for the rest of your life professionally . "
