( @entity0 ) -- i 've written quite a bit about medical myths , so i 'm always a bit skeptical about medical " knowledge . " but one thing i , and i 'm sure many of you , think we understand is obesity . after all , weight issues crop up in media constantly . just last night , gov. @entity13 was joking about donuts and his weight on the @entity16 with @entity17 , and the @entity19 's weight is once again a subject of discussion in the @entity22 - even though by any objective standard she 's in great shape . we know how people gain weight , and we think we know how to lose it . except a study in this week 's @entity30 shows us that 's just not right . pretty much everything we " know " about obesity and weight loss is wrong . let 's start with some things that are true . more than a third of @entity37 are obese . many more are overweight . the @entity39 estimates that obesity - related medical costs were almost $ 150 billion in 2008 , and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $ 1,400 . this does n't count the physical , mental or quality - of - life toll that obesity can levy on a person . few of us dispute that we need to do something about this problem . there are plenty of experts ( present company included ) who will tell you what needs to be done . the sad truth , though , is that lots of that advice ( even mine ) turns out to be mistaken . i know i 've told people that making small , sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time . but it turns out that making such changes , say by deciding to walk a mile every day for five years , results in far less weight loss than you 'd expect . @entity71 weighs in on obesity fight i 've lectured people about the importance of physical education in schools , and i 've seen countless reports declaring that the decrease in @entity79 nationwide is one of the reasons that more children are obese or overweight today . it turns out that studies do n't show that 's the case . my family loves watching " @entity87 . " but i 've found myself telling my kids again and again that what 's shown on tv is n't the best way to lose weight . i tell them that slow and steady works better in the long - run than rapid weight loss . i also tell them that setting unrealistic weight goals can actually sabotage your efforts . so imagine my shock to discover that what evidence exists in this new study hints towards ambitious goals being a good thing , and that quicker weight loss is n't less likely to be kept off in the long - term . people will say eating breakfast is a good idea when you 're trying to lose weight , because it will keep you from binging later . but studies show that there 's no protective effect from eating breakfast at all . people will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight . but studies show that , on their own , eating more of them without making other behavioral changes does n't result in any weight loss . there 's no magic to fruits and vegetables . @entity130 : chefs with issues : farm - to - table should still be on the table people will say that snacking in between meals can lead to weight gain . but studies do n't show that to be the case either . in general , people compensate for snacking throughout the rest of the day . in other words , it 's not necessarily bad to snack outside of usual meal times . it 's all enough to cause one to despair . but just because so much of what we believe is wrong does n't mean we still ca n't do something about the issue . studies do show that you can absolutely overcome genetic and familial factors to lose weight . they show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss , and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general . reducing your caloric intake works overall , especially if it 's done in a way to change your overall eating habits . getting the whole family involved is important . and finally , for some , bariatric surgery can result in life - changing outcomes . over the past five years , my wife and i have lost quite a bit of weight . i 'm down somewhere between 15 % to 20 % of my high of more than 200 pounds . my wife lost even more , although i 'm not going to give you any numbers ( i like being married ) . now that i look back , if i 'm going to be honest about it , i did it in bursts over a few months here and there , each time gaining back less than i had lost . 7 weight loss myths ( sort of ) debunked each time , i had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months , and each time i really restricted my caloric intake . but i 've kept the weight off by radically changing my overall eating habits . my breakfast consists of just coffee , i eat very light lunches , such as salads , and dinner is usually a healthy home - cooked meal with the family . my wife cooks way more than she used to and is obsessed with finding ways to make meals healthier . i avoid fried foods almost entirely , and i ca n't remember the last time i ate in a fast food restaurant . i also get to the gym two to three times each week . i do n't tell you this because i think this is what you should do , or because i think it 's the key to getting thinner . i tell you this because more and more , i think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path . perhaps our problem is we 're trying to find a one - size - fits - all solution . i 'm not sure that exists . lastly , what was left out of this new scientific paper was prevention . the single best way to fight obesity is to avoid it in the first place . that has to start when kids are young , and it 's a lifelong journey . but one thing i doubt will ever be proved false is that it 's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .
