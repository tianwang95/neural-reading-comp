( @entity0 ) -- a @entity2 diplomatic cable written five years ago concluded that the government of @entity4 condoned torture of suspects held in detention centers in @entity8 and @entity9 , a region that has seen a long guerrilla war by @entity12 separatists , many supported by @entity13 . the cable , obtained by @entity15 and published by @entity17 newspaper in @entity18 , describes a confidential briefing from a representative of the @entity21 . in interviews with nearly 1,500 detainees over a three - year period , it had received reports that included sexual abuse , stretching and the use of water and electricity . " the continued ill - treatment of detainees , despite longstanding @entity21 - @entity35 [ @entity35 ] dialogue , have led the @entity21 to conclude that the @entity36 condones torture , " the cable says . for the @entity21 , such a briefing for @entity2 diplomats appears to have been unusual . previously it had limited itself to general comments on the human rights situation in @entity9 " in order to respect their confidentiality agreement with the @entity35 . " however , the relationship had become strained , with @entity21 representatives unable to gain regular access to senior officials . the cable gives a detailed summary of the @entity21 's interviews with detainees . " in 852 cases , detainees reported what @entity21 refers to as " it " ( ill - treatment ) : 171 persons were beaten , the remaining 681 subjected to one or more of six forms of torture : electricity ( 498 cases ) , suspension from ceiling ( 381 ) , " roller " ( a round metal object put on the thighs of sitting person , which prison personnel then sit on , crushing muscles -- 294 ) ; stretching ( legs split 180 degrees -- 181 ) , water ( various forms -- 234 ) , or sexual ( 302 ) . " the @entity21 acknowledged that the human rights situation in @entity9 had improved . ten years previously , there were some 300 detention centers ; now there are " a lot fewer . " it also had meetings with the security forces . the cable noted one " bright spot . " the chief of the @entity87 , lieutenant - general @entity86 , had made discipline a central theme of a recent conference and had stipulated that his officers should use " minimum force " and avoid " collateral damage " in their units in order to reverse declining standards in discipline . but even though the @entity21 has raised issues of abuse for more than 10 years , it continued . " detainees were rarely militants ( they are routinely killed ) , but persons connected to or believed to have information about the insurgency . " the @entity21 representative had never been permitted access to the " @entity107 , " the most notorious detention center in @entity109 . the cable concludes that @entity21 data on " ill - treatment and torture in detention centers are very disturbing , because the practice continues unabated . " @entity4 's @entity115 disputed those claims . " @entity4 is an open and democratic nation , which adheres to the rule of law . if and when an aberration occurs , it is promptly and firmly dealt with under existing legal mechanisms in an effective and transparent manner , " the ministry spokesman @entity122 . " in @entity4 , there 's a healthy tradition of democratic debate and freedom of expression on all issues that concern the welfare of our citizens anywhere in our country . " the @entity21 on friday confirmed the meeting referred to in the cable took place and refrained from commenting " publicly on the content of such discussions . " " it must also be stressed that the @entity21 can not take responsibility for the content of the cables , which emanate from representatives of the @entity2 authorities , " the @entity21 said . @entity21 said it and @entity4 signed an agreement providing for a framework for @entity21 's detention activities . it said the " work is ongoing , " findings are discussed confidentially , and the quality of discussions with @entity4 has " clearly improved . " as for sharing information with the @entity2 , the @entity21 says it " engages in a sustained dialogue with the concerned authorities of the countries where the @entity21 works with the aim of addressing concrete humanitarian issues . in very specific instances this dialogue may be extended to third parties who may play a role in addressing humanitarian situations . " another cable the following year acknowledged the security challenges @entity4 faced in @entity9 . " @entity165 terrorist groups made numerous attacks on elected @entity4 and @entity165 politicians , targeted civilians in public areas , and attacked security forces , killing more than 500 civilians in 2005 , most of whom were @entity174 . " the same cable suggested that political violence in @entity4 was abating . " at a time when many nations appear to be losing ground to extremist movements , @entity4 's trendlines are pointing in the right direction , bolstered by strong indigenous traditions of communal co-habitation , non-violent political protest " and other factors . however , the cable noted that in the absence of training and the collection of evidence " terrorism investigations and court cases tend to rely upon confessions , many of which are obtained under duress if not beatings , threats , or , in some cases , torture . " in 2007 , the @entity2 @entity202 in @entity36 recommended denying a @entity2 visa to a @entity165 paramilitary leader , @entity204 . a leaked cable said the group was " notorious for its use of torture , extra-judicial killing , rape , and extortion of @entity165 civilians suspected of harboring or facilitating terrorists . " there was further unrest in @entity109 , the capital of @entity8 and @entity9 , earlier this year , when the death of a student hit by a tear - gas grenade sparked widespread street protests . tens of thousands of @entity4 security forces remain deployed in the region . the @entity21 has a policy of not sharing with the media its discussions with governments .

the @placeholder acknowledges that the human rights situation in @entity9 has improved .
