@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- beginning saturday and continuing over the next few weeks , some of the nation 's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in . among the more well - known governors who will be leaving office : -- republicans @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity14 of @entity15 and @entity16 of @entity17 -- democrats @entity18 of @entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 , @entity22 of @entity23 , @entity24 of @entity25 and @entity26 of @entity27 some of them are leaving due to term limits , some were defeated and others sought different offices . some are leaving after having survived high - profile scandals . others are departing after weathering a myriad of problems affecting their states . @entity20 , @entity26 and @entity18 will be the first to leave office when their successors are sworn in on saturday . @entity18 told @entity1 he is going to stay in @entity41 , @entity19 , and looks forward to becoming a private citizen after having served as a governor , a cabinet secretary , a @entity46 ambassador and a congressman . " i 'm going to try to set up a foreign policy institute where i continue my work on peacemaking , on rescuing hostages , on @entity54 - @entity53 relations . i 'm going to stay active , " @entity18 told @entity1 's " @entity56 " program on thursday . " i 'm going to be around -- not in @entity19 politics but more at a national and hopefully international level . but you know i need a pause , the people in @entity19 need a pause from me , probably the country needs a pause from me . " having just returned from a trip to @entity66 to help calm recent tensions , @entity18 said he intends to stay involved in that issue and other foreign policy matters but does n't rule out returning to @entity0 one day . @entity10 's last day in office is next monday . it has been a roller coaster for the actor turned politician . after first winning office following the recall of his predecessor , @entity77 , in 2003 , he promised a new approach . while his supporters point to major environmental and political reforms in the state , his popularity plummeted as the state 's fiscal problems mounted . @entity11 confronted major deficits and financial headaches as @entity10 and legislators faced off trying to find solutions to deal with the red ink . in an interview in november on @entity94 's " @entity93 , " @entity10 said he did not have regrets about his decision to run . " it was one of the greatest decisions i ever made because working for the people of @entity11 is really was a great pleasure for me , it was a great honor . it was very rewarding to make some of the decisions that had to be made , and we really moved the state forward , " he told host @entity103 . while detractors such as some of the state 's labor unions have criticized some of the decisions he has made , @entity10 pointed to some of his accomplishments . " i am very happy i became the reform governor , that we reformed workers compensation , that we reformed the primary -- open primaries so that we bring both of the parties closer together , " he said . " i am very happy we took the power away from the legislators and from the lawmakers , the power to draw the district lines ... also all of the environmental laws , " such as ones to reduce greenhouse gases and to encourage alternative energy sources . but he also acknowledged some of the financial problems facing the @entity132 with declarations of fiscal emergencies and several rounds of major spending cuts to popular programs . " i have to say that i am sad that we had a second in my term , a second decline economically , because no matter how much i brag about what we have accomplished it is horrible when you see so many people unemployed . suddenly people losing their jobs . so many people suffering . " on monday , former governor @entity149 , a @entity150 , will once again take the helm of the state as it faces a growing budget gap . it is now estimated its deficit will be $ 28 billion over the next 18 months . even before taking office , @entity149 has been meeting with state officials and legislators to help find ways of dealing with it . the most scandal - ridden governor to be leaving office now is @entity17 's @entity16 , whose fiscal conservative credentials were helping to propel his career . however , last year he admitted lying to his staff when he told them he had gone on a hiking trip on the @entity170 . instead , it turned into a political crisis . before a painful press conference at the state capitol , he went into detail about how he had ventured to @entity176 for a rendezvous with a mistress . eventually his wife , @entity179 , divorced him . despite calls for his resignation and impeachment inquiries , @entity16 persisted and stayed in office . before @entity16 's last day on january 12 , he is scheduled to tour parts of the state to extend thanks to his supporters . in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity189 in @entity190 , @entity16 said one of the things he was most proud in his eight years as governor was bringing some fiscal discipline to the state . one incident of his gubernatorial career will certainly stand out : in 2004 he brought some live pigs into the state house after some of his budget vetoes were overturned , to protest what he considered pork barrel spending . he eventually got his way . " it went to the core of whether we have a balanced budget requirement in the state , " he said . he told the station in the time since his affair became public it has been a time of some accomplishment for the state . " if you look at these last 18 months they have been surprisingly productive , " he said , pointing to some vetoes of bills amounting to savings of about $ 260 million . @entity16 will be succeeded by @entity221 state legislator @entity220 , a rising star in the @entity221 .
