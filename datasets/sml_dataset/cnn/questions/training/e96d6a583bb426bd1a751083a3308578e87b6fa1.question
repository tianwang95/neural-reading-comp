( @entity0 ) -- the @entity1 has protected crime victims and helped police and prosecutors take violent criminals off our streets for nearly 20 years . after it became law in 1994 , it was reauthorized , with robust support from both parties , in 2000 and 2005 . republicans played a prominent role in crafting the act , and particularly its protections for undocumented crime victims . but this time around , @entity18 @entity13 are blocking its reauthorization and proposing a dramatic and dangerous rollback in its protection for immigrant victims of domestic violence , sexual assault and human trafficking . the @entity27 bill undermines two decades of relief for immigrant victims who suffer continuing abuse at the hands of @entity33 citizens or permanent resident spouses or @entity35 has provided undocumented immigrant women and children , who might depend on their abusers for legal status or economic support , a special immigration remedy that helps victims Â become independent and stops their assailants from trying to keep them quiet with threats of deportation . the @entity18 bill breaks with that history by weakening vital confidentiality provisions that protect immigrant spouse and child abuse victims from retaliation by keeping their abusers from interfering with the victims ' immigration case . a @entity55 , a feature of the act , gives a person who is undocumented and a victim of certain violent crimes protection from deportation with legal status and work authorization . it is not easy to get one . you must meet certain criteria and agree to assist and continue assisting in law enforcement investigations and prosecutions . the nonpartisan @entity69 reported that the @entity70 has incorporated safeguards for adjudicating these cases and there is no evidence of fraud . the @entity18 bill would put immigrant crime victims on a path " from report to deport " by making @entity79 temporary and contingent on factors outside the victim 's control , such as whether a rapist has been identified . it would also remove the possibility of lawful permanent resident status for those who , thanks to the @entity55 , are able to summon the courage to report crimes and cooperate in criminal investigations and prosecutions . the @entity55 has been instrumental in solving and preventing crimes . in one dramatic case , a police officer who investigated gangs helped an immigrant victim of domestic violence and sexual assault obtain @entity55 certification from his department . this action ended up saving his life . the victim cooperated in the successful prosecution of her assailant . and she later warned the officer that her abuser 's gang had put out a contract to kill him and his partner . the @entity18 bill 's proposed changes would have ended in her deportation and , perhaps , those officers ' deaths . members of @entity119 who once led efforts to offer immigration relief for crime victims included nearly equal numbers of @entity13 and @entity124 . i had the privilege of assisting these bipartisan collaborations to create special immigration protections for victims of spousal , child and elder abuse , the u-visa for cooperating crime victims and the t - visa for human trafficking victims . the crimes suffered by @entity55 applicants and recipients are predominantly domestic violence , child and elder abuse , at 46 % ; rape , human trafficking and sexual assault , at 29 % ; felonious assault , murder and torture , at 11 % ; and kidnapping and false imprisonment , at 8 % . these are serious crimes indeed , and it is imperative that congressional leaders summon the political will to reauthorize the act before the end of december 2012 . each new incarnation of the act has improved protections . in contrast to the @entity18 bill , the @entity161 bill ( @entity162 ) continues the long bipartisan history of expanding the act to assure better protections for domestic violence and sexual assault survivors . the @entity161 bill extends protection to members of the @entity174 community and native americans ; prevents children from being denied benefits because they have grown too old during the long application process ; expands the pool of @entity79 and adds stalking to the list of covered crimes . it also strengthens protections for foreign fiances and spouses of @entity33 citizens through amendments to the @entity188 . the @entity161 bill addresses an annual shortfall by increasing the cap on @entity79 from 10,000 to 15,000 for each of the next eight years . this is not a net gain in allotted @entity194 , but is a recapture of about 34,000 of roughly 74,000 u-visas that were authorized by @entity119 but never used . from 2001 to 2007 , thousands of applicants were granted interim relief , rather than the @entity196 allotted for those years , while they waited for @entity70 to adjudicate their cases . the @entity18 bill keeps the cap at 10,000 and imposes restrictions that will make it impossible to investigate , solve and prosecute crimes when the victim is an immigrant . every u-visa represents a tip to law enforcement and a cooperating witness . in a survey of nearly 8,000 u-visa cases , 99.45 % of @entity55 applicants and @entity55 holders either provided , or were willing to provide , critical information and ongoing cooperation with police and prosecutors . police departments are benefiting greatly from the value of the @entity55 in building good relationships with immigrant communities . @entity221 would end @entity55 protections and thus discourage victims ' cooperation with law enforcement , destabilizing the trust between police and immigrant communities the law has fostered for many years . immigrant crime victims who receive u-visas have a legal obligation to continue cooperating with law enforcement as a requirement to file for lawful permanent residency . this allows police to maintain important sources of information . @entity33 demographics are changing . today 27 % of the @entity33 population is either immigrants or has one or more immigrant parent . passing the @entity161 's proposals for the @entity1 will allow many victims of terrible crimes to come out of the shadows and find justice and safety . the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .
