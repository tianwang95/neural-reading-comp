( @entity0 ) -- when @entity4 died after donating a piece of his liver to his brother , @entity8 , his friends and family mourned the loss of a hero who risked his life to save his brother . the death affected someone else , too -- someone who 'd never met the @entity15 . her name is @entity17 , and when she learned about @entity4 's death in august in an online television news piece , she was " devastated . " " it hit really close to home , " she told @entity0 . " because i knew that could have been me . " four living liver donors have died in the @entity23 since 1999 , according to the @entity24 , including @entity4 and another patient who died earlier this year at the @entity26 in @entity27 . about 38 % of liver donors have some kind of complication , according to the adult - to - adult @entity31 , a project to disseminate information about living donor liver transplants . some experts think some of these deaths and complications could have been prevented if there was a change the way hospitals exchanged information about complications with organ donations . " my body was just shutting down " like @entity4 , @entity17 was young and feeling great when she gave away part of her liver . both had surgery at the @entity50 , one of the world 's most respected transplant centers . in @entity17 's case , it was her mother , @entity56 , who had a debilitating liver disease and needed a transplant . @entity17 was 26 and her mother 59 when @entity17 had 60 % of her liver surgically removed and given to her mother on september 30 , 2009 , less than a year before @entity4 had the same surgery . at first , everything seemed fine . the surgery went well , and both were discharged from the hospital without complications . when @entity17 got home , everything changed . " i realized i was n't doing as well as i was supposed to be doing , " she remembered . " i was n't eating anything . i was n't keeping anything down , fluids or anything . " @entity56 took her daughter back to the hospital , where doctors admitted her and diagnosed a small bowel obstruction , which meant a section of her intestines was blocked . after three days of treatment in the hospital , she was able to eat and move her bowels , and she was discharged . back at her home in @entity84 once more , @entity17 again started to feel ill , and three days later , she went back to the hospital . " i was really pale . my lips were turning blue , and they could n't find a blood pressure on me , " she said . " my body was just shutting down . ... no one at the hospital said i was going into organ failure , but my mom 's a nurse , and she put two and two together . " @entity17 was rushed to surgery . afterward , the doctors told her parents that @entity17 had a hole in her intestines , a medical emergency because if the hole is n't repaired in time , bacteria inside the intestines leak out and cause deadly infections . @entity17 fought for her life in the intensive care unit , and she spent the next 36 days in the hospital . " there was a time when the doctors came to [ my mother ] and my father and said if this infection does n't clear up within 24 hours , i 'm not going to make it , " she said . " they went to the chapel and prayed . " @entity17 recovered completely , and she hopes doctors learn from her complication and from @entity4 's death , which happened about 10 months apart . she added that she 'd donate to her mother again in a heartbeat . " it was a terrible , terrible situation , but what came out of it is my mom is alive , and i 'm alive , " she said . surgeon : " a devastating feeling " @entity17 and @entity4 had the same surgeon : dr. @entity126 , chief of the division of transplant surgery at the @entity50 . in the past 22 years , the @entity129 has performed 142 living liver surgeries , and @entity126 says he 's been the surgeon for nearly all of them . out of those 142 surgeries , there 's been one death -- @entity4 's -- and three major complications , including @entity17 's . he says @entity4 's death and @entity138 's complications are unrelated . @entity4 was fine after surgery , and he was up and walking around just two days later . " i checked on him personally at 8 o'clock on the third evening after his surgery , and everyone said he was doing great , " @entity126 said . then at midnight , he said , he received a call saying @entity4 needed to be resuscitated . " by that time , he was already dead , " @entity126 said . " he went to sleep and never woke up . " after @entity4 's death , the @entity50 issued a statement saying it was conducting a " thorough review " of his case . @entity126 said @entity17 's complication was ultimately caused by a pre-existing condition that was impossible to detect before the surgery . in her case , he said , one loop of her intestines " kinked on itself " and stuck to another loop of her intestines , and this adhesion caused swelling , which caused the hole in her intestines . sometimes in abdominal surgery , a surgical instrument can poke a hole in the intestines , but that was n't the case with @entity138 , @entity126 said . he said the hole was in a section of the intestines far from her surgical site . plus , he said , the pathologist who looked at the adhesion after it was removed reported that it was chronic and existed before the surgery . @entity126 says he gets a " devastating feeling " whenever there 's a major complication or death of a living liver donor . " i do n't wish anybody , good friends or enemies , to have this type of feeling , " he said . " it 's hard to live with . " he said @entity4 's death hit him especially hard . " i 've lived with it every day , every minute of my life , since then , " he said . after @entity4 's death , the @entity50 stopped doing liver transplants that involved living donors , but it expects to start up again in the next few weeks with new procedures for monitoring patients after the surgery , @entity126 said . @entity193 , a spokeswoman for @entity4 's widow , @entity194 , declined comment when asked if they planned legal action . a call for a living donor death task force when a donor has a complication , the hospital is expected to do its own investigation and report to the @entity24 , or @entity24 , which oversees transplants for the federal government . " this is n't acceptable , " says dr. @entity207 , director of renal and pancreatic transplant surgery at @entity210 . " never in a million years would we say to @entity214 , ' oh , you had an oil spill in the @entity216 , why do n't you do your own investigation and just tell us about it ? ' " he said . " that would be just crazy . it 's not acceptable in other industries to do that , so why is it acceptable in ours ? " in an article published recently in the @entity225 , @entity207 said that a national living donor death task force should be established to systematically review organ donor deaths , and that these findings should be disseminated to all hospitals that perform live donor transplants . he says that right now , the lessons a hospital learns from the death of a donor are not disseminated to other hospitals , and that surgeons tend to learn from one another based on " serendipity . " for example , in 2006 , he and colleagues from another hospital were having lunch when they started discussing patients who 'd died , or had severe complications , when a certain type of surgical clip was used . he said the clip would fall off the stump of a renal artery after the kidney had been removed from the donor . they published their observations in a medical journal , and the major manufacturer of the clips alerted hospitals to stop using them for kidney donors . " we found a suboptimal surgical technique , but it never would have happened if we had n't just gotten interested in this and started to talk about it , " he said . " there should be a system for reporting these problems and learning from each other . " @entity24 told @entity0 that its @entity266 recently advocated a process similar to the one that @entity207 suggested in his article , but it might not be adopted . " while promising , we must weigh procedural and legal issues in determining whether and how to develop such a system , " according to a statement from @entity24 . sharing data with the public transplant centers are required to inform @entity24 when they 've had a death or major complication , but @entity24 does n't share that information with the public , which means patients ca n't look up a hospital 's transplant safety record . @entity284 , a registered nurse who donated a kidney to her sister and once served on the board of @entity24 , says the organization ought to share that information with the public . donors can make a fully informed decision only " if all the data is out there , and we do n't have that data , " she said . in a statement to @entity0 , @entity24 emphasized that serious complications and deaths are rare , and that " through data collection and the input of many who have personal experience with living donation , we will do our utmost to minimize risks for future potential donors . " @entity0 's @entity307 contributed to this report .
