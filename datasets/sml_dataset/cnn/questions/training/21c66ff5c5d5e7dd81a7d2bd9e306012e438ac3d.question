( @entity0 ) -- @entity3 's 10 - wicket hero and man - of - the - match @entity1 admitted to total exhaustion after his side held off a gritty @entity7 fight back to win an extraordinary first @entity8 by 14 runs . " it has been draining emotionally and physically , " said @entity1 . " i 'm lost for words - it 's been amazing . " but the first @entity8 also threw up questions about the use of technology in sport , with @entity17 ruing the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) that appeared to weigh heavily against the @entity17 . @entity0 looks at five things we learned from the first test at @entity22 . technology equals controversy unlike football , which has grappled with the issue of technological assistance for its embattled referees for years , cricket has long been comfortable with a little high tech help for its umpires . @entity18 has been around in cricket since 2009 ; while not without its dissenters , by and large it has brought clarity and dampened down controversy in big games . not in this match though . as the old bumper sticker says , " to err is human ; to foul things up completely requires a computer , " except here the human element was solely to blame . from umpire @entity42 's failure to pick up @entity44 's clear edge to @entity17 's wicketkeeper @entity45 , to a dozy ' hot - spot ' camera operator who was still reviewing the previous ball as @entity3 appealed @entity51 's dismissal , this was an error - strewn performance by both the on and off - field umpiring team . the look on @entity7 captain @entity55 's face when he realized his profligate use of appeals had left him without recourse to the third umpire as @entity44 stood his ground summed up the frustration around @entity18 @entity44 's decision not to walk was huge in itself , and prompted an impassioned debate that will linger for some time -- some argued that he was a disgrace , others that he was simply being professional . interestingly the people who seemed least bothered by it were the players , possibly because -- with very few exceptions -- no one in top - flight cricket walks any more . in the words of former @entity7 wicketkeeper @entity75 , " walk in an ashes test match ? only if the car runs out of petrol ! " interestingly though , @entity44 did n't wait for the umpire 's signal when he did eventually depart . perhaps even he was a bit embarrassed . in the final analysis , much as was always argued when the umpires acted alone , the mistakes just about balanced themselves out . certainly , the @entity7 captain could learn much from the approach of his opposite number @entity87 , who used his appeals wisely -- especially for the final decisive wicket . but the fact that technology 's role was so central to so much controversy at @entity22 must be cause for concern . @entity1 is a true great while the great @entity7 side that dominated world cricket from the early 90s into the 21st century was full of stars , its bowling attack was arguably the key to its supremacy . alongside the genius of spinner @entity107 it was the metronomic precision and controlled aggression of fast bowler @entity109 that kept the game 's best batsmen in check . if the current @entity7 side is crying out for such a presence , @entity3 can rest easy in the knowledge that they have their own @entity109 in @entity1 . the @entity118 pace bowler has matured into an intimidating mix of cool exactitude and thoughtful endeavour . for over after over he pinned the @entity7 attack back , reining them in each time they threatened to break free and ensuring they could never relax . it was a performance , on a pretty lifeless pitch , that underlined why he can now justifiably be ranked among the greatest pace bowlers . his 10 wickets added to a career tally that should eventually see him overtake @entity134 as @entity3 's highest wicket - taker . and his 10th wicket , albeit gained by the finest of margins and the faintest edge , may well be among those that come to define this @entity8 series . @entity17 is here to win @entity17 arrived in @entity3 as clear underdogs , before cementing this status with an implosion in the @entity145 that indicated a team in disarray . if off field disciplinary issues and major changes in the coaching staff left many wondering what kind of shape this team would be in for the first test , all agreed that -- on paper at least -- it had a long batting line - up . none , however , would have predicted just how long . making his test debut at just 19 , there were few indications that @entity163 , taking the field with @entity17 on the brink of oblivion at 117 for 9 , would deliver such a dazzling performance . but what a performance it was -- full of eye - catching stroke play and stylish shots that reached all parts of @entity22 , watched by a gaping crowd that became gradually more appreciative as the records tumbled . as the highest ever score by an @entity7 number 11 became the highest ever score by any number 11 , @entity109 remarked that he thought he 'd been presenting @entity163 's @entity183 cap to a bowler , not an all - rounder . as the debutant reached 98 , it seemed the whole stadium , as well as most of those observing via @entity190 , were willing him into triple figures . it was n't to be , as an overly ambitious boundary attempt from the bowling of the @entity8 's soon - to - be pantomime villain , @entity44 , was lofted into the hands of @entity198 ; but the standing ovation he received was heartfelt . yes , he possibly should have been given out earlier , and it was n't quite enough to win the match for the @entity7 , but no one , @entity205 or @entity7 , will forget that innings . at the other end of the age scale , the veteran @entity45 's performance on the final day was no less impressive , aided by @entity210 he brought his team within a whisker of an implausible victory . @entity3 beware : this team has a whale of a tail and bowlers will need to be at their best to clear the @entity7 decks . the @entity8 are still worth fighting for the appeal of the @entity8 comes in large part from the fearsome way in which the series is contested . when @entity3 finally reclaimed the tiny urn in 2005 it was a release so cathartic that it elevated the series to new heights in the @entity228 ; and made @entity17 all the more determined to reclaim the prize , which they did emphatically in 2007 . however , recent contests have felt less competitive . as the @entity7 struggled to rebuild , and @entity3 became ever more proficient and professional , it felt as though this year 's series might lack a little of the appeal of recent years . by sunday at @entity22 , those fears had been dispelled so emphatically that the very idea of a lacklustre @entity8 seemed laughable . this was , it was unanimously agreed , one of the best ever @entity240 , and quite possibly one of the best ever @entity8 matches . new rivalries , fresh controversies and innumerable talking points conspired to ensure that the second test will be the most hotly anticipated for years . the fact that much of the @entity228 is currently basking in a heatwave only added to the sense of enjoyment from the home fans , but even in defeat the @entity7 could draw succour from the fact that their team can clearly make a decent fist of winning the series . @entity55 's dignified speech as he congratulated @entity3 spoke of a man well aware he had been part of something special . and best of all , this is just the beginning of back - to - back series in 2013 . test cricket is still uniquely compelling by the end of wednesday those fans with tickets for saturday 's action were justifiably pondering other plans . batsman after batsman failed to rein in his desire to play at every delivery , with wickets lost due primarily to poor decision making . @entity274 , too , was erratic -- the @entity7 giving away 21 runs to the extras column . even the idea that the match could be over before friday was being seriously discussed , and inevitably that discussion turned to the format of test cricket . @entity283 , it was agreed , were too used to the speed of @entity285 and 50 - over games ; skills that fed a long innings , such as the ability to safely leave a ball , had been lost in the pressure to score quickly . punters preferred the quick fix entertainment of shorter forms of the game and this was the result . as the @entity8 entered the afternoon session on the fifth day , however , it became clear that this type of cricket still offers something unique . this was like choosing an emmy award winning dvd box set over a summer sci - fi blockbuster . as the hours and days rolled by , nuance , sub-plots , character development and twists were revealed that would be impossible in the frenetic environment of limited overs cricket . @entity22 was by turns feather bed and cauldron for the protagonists as the game 's story evolved ; nails were shorn to their stumps , eyes raised plaintively to the heavens by players and fans alike , cries of anguish were matched by sighs of relief and gasps of wonderment , eyes squinted intently at the square throughout . this utterly enthralling contest was the perfect reminder of what test cricket can offer .
