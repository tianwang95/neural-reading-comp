( @entity0 ) -- sitting in a dark , abandoned sports complex with the constant crack of gunshots and the cries of angry protesters ringing in his head , @entity1 decided he had to leave the bloodshed in @entity11 once and for all . the 23 - year - old @entity14 basketball player had tried several times to get to the airport , but his efforts were repeatedly derailed by mercenaries , soldiers , and bureaucratic red tape . now safely on a @entity14 - chartered ferry bound for @entity22 with about 300 other passengers -- 167 of them fellow @entity14 -- @entity24 said friday he 'll only let himself feel relief when he 's back in the @entity14 . " there 's so many details i just ca n't get into until i get home and feel safe , but at least i 've made it this far , " said @entity24 , who had come to @entity11 only three weeks ago to play on a government - run team backed by @entity11 leader @entity29 's son , @entity28 . " i 'm just thankful to be alive , " he told @entity0 . " just unbelievable . ... anything could have happened . there was no guarantee i was going to get out safely . " even though he 's on his way home to @entity40 , he 's still haunted by stories of those he left behind , including a teammate who was held at gunpoint by a mercenary one day as he tried to get to the airport . a @entity11 soldier was able to calm the mercenary down , @entity24 said . " he definitely was in serious danger and probably would have been killed . ... the mercenary was very , very violent and aggressive ; he just looked like he was itching to shoot somebody . " for @entity14 @entity52 and @entity53 , the sound of protests and gunfire that kept getting closer and closer to their neighborhood just outside the @entity11 capital ultimately forced them to make a dash for the airport in hopes of leaving the violence behind . " the crowds sounded as if more and more people were joining in , ( and ) just hearing the gunfire and just knowing that people were probably losing their lives " finally made them pack up , @entity70 told @entity0 's " @entity71 " on thursday . they and other @entity14 who have fled @entity11 's descent into chaos have harrowing tales of escaping the carnage . as @entity24 ran out of food and money -- living off of a single bowl of spaghetti for the past two days -- he decided he had to take a chance and get to the airport to leave the country . it was a fateful decision by the former @entity86 star point guard , so used to taking chances on the court but feeling out of his element in a foreign city under siege . as the @entity94 headed to the airport , they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by soldiers with machine guns , a scene @entity53 described as " terrifying . " " they knocked on the window ... they wanted to see our passports , " he explained . " it was scary , " @entity70 added . @entity105 , 24 , returned to @entity106 on tuesday from @entity11 , where the dual citizen was working with @entity108 as an auditor of oil companies . as security forces started cracking down on protesters , @entity105 said he , like other @entity114 residents , became fearful for his life and the lives of his family members . he picked up a baseball bat to use as a weapon , if he needed one ; his neighbors fortified the streets and guarded their homes . at the airport , the scene was one of confusion and disorder , @entity24 and the @entity94 said . " the airport was full to capacity . they were not allowing anyone else in , " said @entity53 , who had been working on a land development project in @entity11 for the previous month . but " our ( @entity11 ) driver had an uncle at the airport , thank @entity138 , and he was able to get us in , but once we got in , you could n't even move " because it was so crowded , he said . @entity141 , who was in @entity11 with his @entity143 - based construction company building roads and bridges , described the airport scene as " utter chaos . " " i would say there was approximately 30 - 40,000 people , most of them without tickets , trying to get into the three entrances to the terminal , " @entity141 told @entity0 on friday . " we pretty much had to push and shove our way through thousands of people , and myself and two of my colleagues finally made it after about three hours of pushing , shoving , and kicking . " another contractor who managed a tight escape was @entity160 , who was working as an electrical engineer in @entity11 for a @entity163 - based firm . he said it took him six hours to get from the airport parking lot to the ticket counter . @entity160 said it was a " very extreme experience " that he 'll never forget . @entity24 found himself crushed between the gates and travelers storming to get in after he arrived at the airport . " i got in a skirmish , actually , trying to calm people down and got pushed to the ground by a guard and when i got up he hit me in the face and there were a couple other guys i saw get hit as well . " in the end he got a ticket and arrived at the departure area , but that was the end of the line . immigration officials saw that there was no entrance stamp on his @entity14 passport , and refused to let him board his flight , or book a new ticket out . @entity189 is a dual @entity14 - @entity191 citizen and had used his @entity191 passport to enter the country . he said he did n't think twice when he turned the passport over to his agent after getting the entrance stamp . he returned to the abandoned sports complex and managed to call the @entity14 embassy , but officials there would only tell him to keep away from the windows and wait out the violence . he learned about the chartered ferry in talking to @entity0 , and decided to make a run for it around dawn wednesday when the fewest number of people were in the streets . calls to his agent finally got through and his @entity191 passport was returned along with a ride out to the port . his teammate , a @entity14 resident whose name @entity189 did n't want published for fear of his safety , did n't think he 'd be allowed on the ferry since he was not yet a @entity14 citizen . he planned to make another attempt to get to the airport , but his whereabouts are unknown . on board the ferry , @entity24 said people stretched out on the floors to sleep , feeling safe at last . those awake shared stories about their escape and the violence they had witnessed , but also fears about friends and family left behind . a @entity14 @entity198 official on board the ship , which was delayed for nearly two days because of high seas , warned @entity189 not to speak to the media before departure , explaining that revealing details about the situation could jeopardize the safety of all those on board . as for the @entity94 , now staying with family in @entity248 , they 're also worried about the friends they left behind . " it 's just sad , " @entity53 said . @entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , and @entity254 contributed to this report
