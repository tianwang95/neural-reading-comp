@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- tensions are running high in the skies between @entity4 and @entity5 -- and the @entity6 is refusing to stay on the sidelines . after @entity9 upset the region by declaring a new air defense zone over a large part of the @entity13 , two unarmed @entity6 b - 52 bombers flew through the area in what the @entity15 said was a planned military exercise . the @entity6 aircraft ignored @entity4 's new demands that planes that fly through the zone identify themselves and submit flight plans to @entity4 authorities -- despite @entity9 's warnings that it could take military measures against aircraft that failed to comply . the delicate situation is a test of how @entity4 's increasingly assertive approach beyond its borders will play out against the @entity6 government 's promise to focus more on @entity33 and uphold commitments to its allies . " @entity4 is busy designing and implementing a bolder foreign policy in light of an anticipated @entity6 decline , " @entity36 , director of @entity38 programs at the @entity39 , writes in a commentary for @entity1 this week . the air zone declaration is a clear example of the new approach of @entity4 president @entity48 , who has been in power for about a year , according to @entity36 . " unlike his predecessors , @entity48 is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power , increasingly probing @entity6 commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo , " she says . but for the time being , the @entity6 government is standing its ground in the @entity13 . war of words the @entity6 and @entity5 have criticized @entity9 's air defense announcement , saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident . they say they wo n't recognize the new zone . @entity4 hit back at those comments with strong words of its own , describing the @entity6 and @entity5 statements as unreasonable and unacceptable . after news of the @entity6 flights emerged , the @entity4 defense ministry responded cautiously wednesday , saying it had monitored the planes ' activity on the edge of the air defense zone . the statement held back from criticizing the @entity6 action . at a regular briefing later wednesday , a journalist asked a @entity4 foreign ministry spokesman if @entity9 is concerned it will now be seen as a " paper tiger . " " i want to emphasize that the @entity4 government has enough resolution and capability to safeguard the country 's sovereignty and security , " the spokesman , @entity90 replied . simmering dispute the bomber flights are the strongest @entity6 involvement yet in a festering territorial dispute in the region between @entity4 and @entity5 over a set of small , uninhabited islands in the @entity13 . after @entity4 's air defense declaration saturday , @entity6 defense secretary @entity104 reiterated @entity6 support for @entity5 , where thousands of @entity6 troops are stationed as part of a security agreement . he said the @entity6 @entity5 @entity110 applies to the disputed islands , known as @entity112 by @entity5 and @entity112 by @entity4 . uneasy encounters between @entity4 and @entity5 planes and ships have already taken place repeatedly over the past year near the islands , which are believed to have large oil reserves located near them . tensions spiked after the @entity5 government purchased some of the islands from a private owner in september 2012 , angering @entity4 authorities , who saw the move as an attempt by @entity5 to tighten control . @entity129 warned that @entity4 's " unilateral action " of declaring the air defense zone " increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations . " amid the tensions , @entity6 vice president @entity135 will visit the region next week on a previously announced trip , stopping in @entity138 , @entity9 and @entity139 , @entity140 . why @entity4 's new air zone incensed @entity5 , @entity6 difficult to monitor the @entity6 bomber flights monday also highlight the challenges that analysts say @entity4 faces in policing its newly claimed air zone . in its statement wednesday , the @entity4 defense ministry said that " @entity4 has the capability to exercise effective control " over the area . " @entity9 might have bitten off a bit more than they can chew because actually going out and monitoring these things on an ongoing basis is probably a bit beyond the capabilities of the @entity4 air force right now , " said @entity151 , @entity33 managing editor of @entity152 , an aviation and aerospace industry website . " in a sense , it 's more a rhetorical statement , as opposed to a realistic military space , " @entity162 said . adding to the complications and confusion surrounding the zone , @entity5 's two main commercial airlines said wednesday that following a request from the @entity5 government , they and other members of the @entity171 of @entity5 will not submit flight plans to @entity4 authorities for flights through the zone claimed by @entity9 . the two carriers , @entity178 and @entity179 , said the association had concluded that there would be " no impact " on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to @entity4 . but @entity162 said he was n't entirely sure about that . from a legal point of view , he said , the airlines probably do n't have to report their plans and follow all the rules requested by @entity4 . " i think from a safety perspective , it 's a good idea for them to do so , " @entity162 said . " just in case . " ' the right of every country ' since it declared the new air defense zone at the weekend , @entity4 has been busy making its case for why it feels the move was justified . it has pointed out that other countries already operate air defense identification zones in waters around their territory , noting that @entity5 has had a zone in place in the @entity13 since the 1960s . " it 's natural , it 's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity , its sovereignty are safeguarded , " @entity4 's @entity213 ambassador @entity212 said tuesday . but analysts say that by declaring a zone that now overlaps with that of @entity5 , @entity4 has increased the likelihood of a high - risk incident in the air . @entity140 and @entity225 have also criticized the @entity4 announcement . the situation has remained tense around the islands over the past year . @entity5 has repeatedly scrambled fighter jets in response to @entity4 government planes flying near the islands . and ships from the two countries regularly engage in high seas games of cat and mouse in waters around the islands . @entity4 slams ' inappropriate ' @entity6 remarks on territorial dispute with @entity5 aircraft carrier on the move on top of the already strained situation , @entity4 's military announced on its website early wednesday that its navy 's sole aircraft carrier , the @entity250 , was heading toward the @entity251 . that 's where @entity4 has had territorial disputes with other @entity33 nations including the @entity256 and @entity257 . the carrier , which was commissioned in september 2012 and first had aircraft leaving and landing on it two months later , set out from a shipyard in eastern @entity4 's @entity262 on tuesday morning , the military said on its website . as with @entity6 aircraft carriers , it does n't travel alone : two guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates are accompanying the massive ship as part of its group . the @entity4 military makes no mention of the dispute with @entity5 and its ally , the @entity6 . rather , its website post notes that the carrier group 's mission is to conduct training and tests . but in order to get from @entity262 to the @entity251 , the aircraft carrier group has to first go through the @entity13 . it remained unclear how close it would sail to the disputed islands . " there are several possible courses for the voyage from @entity262 to the @entity251 and it is not clear which the @entity250 will take , " the state - run newspaper @entity281 reported wednesday . at the same time , @entity6 and @entity5 forces are due to hold joint naval exercises this week off @entity290 -- a few hundred kilometers from the disputed islands . @entity1 's @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 and @entity298 contributed to this report .
