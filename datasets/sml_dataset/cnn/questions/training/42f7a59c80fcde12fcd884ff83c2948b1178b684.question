@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 did not expect to become the subject of a biography . she thought the narrow borders of her life -- lived " between the house and the chicken yard " -- would n't give a writer much to work with . author @entity3 ( here with two of her peacocks ) remains a subject of fascination for many . it would therefore come as a surprise ( and probably secretly please her ) to learn she is the focus of at least three . the latest is " @entity3 : a life of @entity3 " ( @entity21 ) by @entity22 , an exhaustively researched exploration of @entity3 's unlikely journey from shy , sarcastic and " contrary " @entity26 girl to acerbic literary treasure . that she suffered from lupus and died before the age of 40 is well - known to fans of @entity3 . but @entity22 uncovers much that even ardent followers of the author will find revealing , including details of her college career as a cartoonist , and her time in @entity36 at the @entity37 . the book manages to synthesize what seems difficult to reconcile : how such a chaste , religious person could produce stories that are bitingly funny and filled with shocking violence . watch @entity3 's fascinating story Â» @entity22 spoke with @entity2 about his experience researching the biography . what follows is an edited version of the interview . @entity2 : when did you first discover @entity3 ? @entity22 : i first read her stories in my 20s and loved them , and then a little later , the [ collected ] letters came up , " the habit of being . " and i 'd had a few hunches about her from reading the stories , which were a little mysterious . ... and then when i read the letters , a lot of those hunches seemed true . ... trying to put the life of this woman together with the stories became as interesting as the stories to me . @entity2 : she was n't always known as @entity3 . @entity22 : her name was @entity3 , and her mother and everyone in @entity67 ( @entity26 ) , where she lived most of her life , continued to call her @entity3 . but when she went to @entity36 -- the @entity37 -- early on , she decided she wanted to be a writer , and she decided on the name @entity3 . she later said , " who would want to buy these stories of an @entity74 washerwoman named @entity75 ? " partly , i think she wanted to lose the @entity77 - ness of " @entity3 . " ... also , @entity3 was a gender - neutral name . ... her initial rejection letters were actually addressed to " mr. @entity3 , " and i think she kind of liked that neutrality . @entity2 : what did you find most remarkable about her ? @entity22 : i think the discipline of her writing becomes ... almost inspiring . she developed lupus when she was 25 , she lived until she was 39 . and in that period , she kept up this regimen that she had begun at the @entity37 of writing every morning for three hours , even if it meant sitting in front of a blank page . ... [ near the end of her life ] she was editing her final stories and hiding them under the pillow in the hospital from the doctors so that she could go on . she was still working on her last story after she had last rites . ... all of that is a sort of [ a ] level of commitment that is startling and unmatched . @entity2 : her stories are often funny , yet disturbing . @entity22 : her style goes under these names , like grotesque or gothic , but she was really crossing these two wires of humor and almost this kind of dark theological writing that had never been put together before . ... [ in " a good man is hard to find " ] a family on vacation ... meets someone named the @entity112 , this ex-con in the woods . ... and he winds up shooting the entire family while spouting existentialist , nihilist philosophy . and in that story , there 's always a point where you keep laughing past this line , and suddenly someone 's being shot and you 're laughing and then [ readers ] get very uncomfortable . they ca n't tell whether this is supposed to be funny or not , and i think that @entity3 definitely works in that territory , where you ca n't tell if she 's being funny or tragic and serious . @entity2 : the titles of her stories and novels are so wonderful -- " @entity112 , " " @entity135 , " " @entity136 , " " @entity137 . " @entity22 : " a good man is hard to find " was a @entity139 song ; " @entity135 " she got from @entity140 , a favorite @entity141 theologian of hers . you see in a way how sophisticated she was in her approach to her writing . i think sometimes when people read the stories , they confuse @entity3 with the character in her story , and they think she is some @entity153 - crazy - folk - artist , but actually she was an incredibly educated artist who had read everything , including a lot of theology . ... the titles ... are attracting and punchy , but you also see that she 's working kind of consciously with these reverberating references . @entity2 : what do you make of her fascination with birds ? @entity22 : when she was forced by lupus to move back to the @entity77 and live on a dairy farm with her mother in @entity26 , one of the first things she did besides getting very serious about working on her stories was to order a peacock . and eventually she had 39 peacocks . ... and i think that she was very conscious that the peacock was this gawky , comic bird . i think she identified with the peacock for that reason . the peacock squawked all night and annoyed people , ate her mother 's flowers , and yet , at this certain willful moment , opened its tail and revealed what she called this " map of the universe . " so , i think it really stood in a way for this kind of transfiguration that would take place for her spiritually but also in the beauty of her writing . ... she definitely made an effort to make the peacock her own personal logo . @entity2 : what is her literary reputation 45 years after her death ? @entity22 : she seems to be ever more popular . when she died she was considered almost a minor writer . her second volume of stories had n't even come out ; her " @entity202 " was published in the early 1970s and got a posthumous @entity201 . it seems that every decade , interest in her grows . when the @entity206 put out her collected works 10 years ago , she outsold @entity208 . so she has this popularity and interest . and [ she ] increasingly shows up in funny pop culture ways . i think in the last episode of " @entity213 " the character was reading " @entity135 " in the last scene . so , counterintuitively , she 's only growing in importance . @entity2 : it 's amazing that she had a literary career at all , given how debilitating her illness was . @entity22 : what became inspiring to me , unexpectedly , writing this book [ was how she dealt ] with her illness , and that she finally was nobody 's victim . ... everything we think of as a @entity3 story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the @entity77 . you get the sense that this was almost a magical thinking , where she thought that writing these stories was keeping her alive .
