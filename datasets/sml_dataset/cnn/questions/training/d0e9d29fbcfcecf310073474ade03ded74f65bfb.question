( @entity0 ) -- accusations of blame abounded thursday , a day after a 28 - year - old man who had volunteered for a center that serves gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people was taken into custody for allegedly shooting a building manager at the headquarters of a @entity12 conservative group . " let me be clear that @entity18 was responsible for firing the shot yesterday , " @entity14 president @entity13 told reporters in @entity16 about the suspect . " but @entity18 was given a license to shoot an unarmed man by organizations like the @entity23 that have been reckless in labeling organizations hate groups because they disagree with them on public policy . " @entity13 said the @entity23 " should be held accountable for their reckless use of terminology that is leading to the intimidation and what the @entity33 here has categorized as an act of domestic terrorism . " who is @entity16 shooting suspect ? prosecutors said they are still investigating the motive behind the shooting , and the motive could determine whether @entity18 is charged with domestic terrorism or hate crimes . in a statement , the @entity23 described as " outrageous " the suggestion that it had contributed to the attack . the @entity14 , which focuses on family and anti-abortion issues and religious liberties , recently supported @entity52 - a president @entity53 , who had become embroiled in controversy after making comments in support of traditional marriage . " we are very much supportive of the family , the biblical definition of the family unit , " @entity58 told @entity59 in an interview published july 16 . " we are a family - owned business , a family - led business , and we are married to our first wives . we give @entity67 thanks for that . " the statement sparked an uproar , with activists saying that @entity58 voiced opposition to gay marriages . @entity18 , who was carrying 15 @entity52 sandwiches in his bag when he was taken into custody , " has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner , " authorities said in the complaint filed against @entity77 , citing the suspect 's parents , with whom he lives in @entity80 , @entity81 , outside @entity16 . asked what evidence he had linking the center to the shooting , @entity13 referred to the @entity52 matter . " you have seen @entity14 listed in many of those stories -- that @entity52 supports and underwrites the @entity14 . chicken , with a side of politics " and in those stories where it says the @entity14 , it says they 're a certified hate group by the @entity23 . we 've seen that term used increasingly over the last two years and it marginalizes individuals and organizations , letting people feel free to go and do bodily harm to innocent people who are simply working and representing folks all across this country . " he said the company donated $ 1,000 to the @entity14 " a number of years ago " but does not underwrite his group . the @entity14 says it promotes " faith , family and freedom in public policy and public opinion . " @entity124 president @entity123 also criticized the @entity23 , saying that its listing of the @entity14 on its website was equating the group with violent extremist groups . " the responsibility is on the shooter , but we need to have a civil debate over issues like redefining marriage , " he said thursday on @entity0 's " @entity129 . " " but we should not be attacking and labeling as hate groups those that we disagree ( with ) . we should condemn violence of any sort , but we should also be responsible . " in its statement , the @entity23 said it had listed the @entity14 as a hate group since 2010 " because it has knowingly spread false and denigrating propaganda about @entity145 people -- not , as some claim , because it opposes same - sex marriage . " " the @entity14 and its allies on the religious right are saying , in effect , that offering legitimate and fact - based criticism in a democratic society is tantamount to suggesting that the objects of criticism should be the targets of criminal violence . " the @entity23 criticizes the @entity14 for asserting , " in @entity13 ' words , that pedophilia is ' a homosexual problem ' -- an utter falsehood , as every relevant scientific authority has stated . an @entity14 official has said he wanted to ' export homosexuals from the @entity164 . ' the same official advocated the criminalizing of homosexuality . " @entity13 was using wednesday 's shooting " to pose a false equivalency between the @entity23 's criticisms of the @entity14 and the @entity14 's criticisms of @entity145 people , " the @entity23 said . " the @entity14 routinely pushes out demonizing claims that gay people are child molesters and worse -- claims that are provably false . it should stop the demonization and affirm the dignity of all people . " in wake of shootings , opinions on gun control unchanged one legal expert said @entity13 seems to be inconsistent in deciding which battles to pick . after dr. @entity188 , a @entity190 abortion provider , was shot dead in may 2009 , @entity187 host @entity186 came under criticism for having called him " @entity188 the baby killer . " referring to @entity186 , @entity13 announced in august that year that " we 're going to give him an award for his courage in exposing the truth behind the late - term abortion industry . " " i wish @entity13 would not use a double standard , " @entity200 professor @entity199 told @entity0 in a telephone interview . " when opponents of abortion engage in astonishingly bellicose speech where they call people ' murderers ' and they virtually encourage people to take their lives and some nut acts on it , @entity13 keeps his mouth shut . i do n't see him criticizing that speech . the truth is , you ca n't pick and choose what kind of rhetoric to condemn . " by the numbers : guns in @entity164

" @placeholder was given a license to shoot , " @entity14 president says
