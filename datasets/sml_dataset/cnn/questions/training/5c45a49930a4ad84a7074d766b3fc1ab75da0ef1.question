( @entity0 ) -- like thousands of other @entity3 women , @entity1 took to @entity5 's streets this week , her heart brimming with hope . " change , " said the placards around her . @entity3 women demonstrate thursday in the streets of @entity5 , the capital city . the young @entity3 woman eyed the crowd and pondered the possibility that the rest of her life might be different from her mother 's . she could see glimmers of a future free from discrimination -- and all the symbols of it , including the head - covering the government requires her to wear every day . women , regarded as second - class citizens under @entity3 law , have been noticeably front and center of the massive demonstrations that have unfolded since the presidential election a week ago . @entity3 are protesting what they consider a fraudulent vote count favoring hardline incumbent @entity32 , but for many women like @entity1 , the demonstrations are just as much about taking @entity3 one step closer to democracy . " women have become primary agents of change in @entity3 , " said @entity36 , chairwoman of the @entity37 at @entity38 , @entity39 . the remarkable images show women with uncovered heads who are unafraid to speak their minds and crowds that are not segregated -- both the opposite of the norm in @entity3 , @entity36 said . she said a long - brewing women 's movement may finally be manifesting itself on the streets and empowering women like @entity1 . " this regime is against all humanity , more specifically against all women , " said @entity1 , whom @entity0 is not fully identifying for security reasons . " i see lots of girls and women in these demonstrations , " she said . " they are all angry , ready to explode , scream out and let the world hear their voice . i want the world to know that as a woman in this country , i have no freedom . " though 63 percent of all @entity3 college students are women , the law of the land does not see men and women as equal . in cases of divorce , child custody , inheritance and crime , women do not have the same legal rights as men . in the past four years , @entity32 has made it easier for men to practice polygamy and harder for women to access public sector jobs , according to @entity0 's chief international correspondent @entity86 . @entity86 , who has reported extensively from @entity3 , describes @entity3 women as " very strong . " in 1997 , it was women who came out along with young people to put reformist candidate @entity91 into the presidency , @entity86 said . increasingly , women 's voices are gaining power as their numbers rise and their demands grow louder . even the granddaughter of @entity99 , the architect of the @entity101 republic , voiced frustration at the way women are treated . " women are just living things , " @entity105 told @entity86 . " a woman is there to fill her husband 's stomach and raise children . " for the first time , women were allowed to register for the presidential race , though none , including @entity105 , were deemed fit to run by the religious body that vets candidates . but women 's issues surfaced in the campaign . that was partly the result of a women 's movement comprised of educated , urban , middle - class women that has grown in recent years with the addition of more conservative and poorer women , said @entity36 , a longtime observer of women 's rights in @entity3 . ironically , traditional women first gained voice under the clerics . " @entity99 needed their votes , so he encouraged them to be publicly active , " @entity36 said . the middle - class women who enjoyed certain freedoms in prerevolutionary days refused to turn back , while a new generation of conservatives were awakened to feminism . in 2003 , lawyer and women 's rights activist @entity139 won the @entity141 , providing a " big boost " for @entity3 women , @entity36 said . at the same time , private organizations and charities that deal with women 's issues blossomed under the presidency of reformist @entity91 , growing by as much as 700 percent , @entity36 said . marriage age increased as more women opted to marry for love , instead of entering arranged marriages . the @entity152 officially launched in 2006 sprouted new discourse and attention with a petition that asks the parliament to reform gender discriminatory laws . in this year 's presidential campaign , @entity3 women pressured candidates to agree to ratify the @entity161 on the elimination of all forms of @entity164 . the 1979 treaty has been ratified by 186 nations , including several @entity101 states . two opposition candidates , @entity169 and @entity170 , vowed to look into parts of the @entity3 constitution that defer women 's rights to what is regarded as an outdated version of sharia , or @entity101 , law . @entity169 had even promised to appoint women as cabinet ministers for the first time . some women in @entity3 looked to @entity169 to carry their banner , perhaps because they were inspired by his wife , @entity183 , a much - admired academic who told @entity0 's @entity86 that @entity3 's 34 million women want civil laws and family laws revised . author and journalist @entity187 , who spent several years working in @entity3 , said @entity32 's fundamentalism has pushed @entity3 women to the edge . " he has been a catastrophe for women , " said @entity187 , who wrote " @entity193 " and co-authored " @entity192 " with @entity191 . the weight of discrimination against women is felt most profoundly through @entity3 's legal system , but @entity187 said @entity32 added to the hardship by clamping down on women 's lifestyles . he mandated the way women dress and even censored web sites that dealt with women 's health , @entity187 said . a woman would be hard - pressed to conduct a @entity209 search for something as simple as breast cancer . @entity187 was almost arrested because her coat sleeves were too short and exposed too much skin . in that setting , she said , it 's striking to see women protesting , especially without their hijabs , or head coverings . " while it 's not at the top of women 's grievances , the hijab is symbolic . taking it off is like waving a red flag , " @entity187 said . " women are saying they are a force to be reckoned with . " @entity227 , a professor at @entity229 's @entity228 and author of " @entity231 in @entity5 , " said she has been watching the footage from @entity3 with " inordinate pride . " she marched on the streets during the 1979 revolution because she believed in greater freedoms for her people , only to see her dreams shattered as hardline clerics took hold of @entity3 . " @entity231 " is largely a memoir of her harrowing days in @entity3 until 1997 , when she immigrated to the @entity242 . " the way i walked down the street became a political statement , " @entity227 said . she recalled her own mother being a devout muslim who chose not to wear a veil . her grandmother , like more traditional women in @entity3 , wore a veil but resented the government ordering her to do so . covering up , @entity227 said , was a matter of faith , not politics . @entity227 believes that women have become a symbolic statement of the power of the @entity101 state . she called @entity3 women canaries of the mind -- barometers of how free society is . it 's impossible to predict what will transpire in @entity3 in the coming days . @entity227 believes a regime change will not be enough ; that only a change in mindset can lead to greater freedoms for women . @entity187 said the sheer scale of the demonstrations assures her that the political and social climate will never again be the same in @entity3 . @entity36 is keeping her fingers crossed that the protests wo n't prompt @entity3 's hardliners to clamp down and rule by repression . but all of them shared the hopes of the women -- like @entity1 -- who are marching on the streets . " today , we were wearing black , " @entity1 said , referring to the day of mourning to remember those who have died in post-election violence . " we were holding signs . we said , ' we are not sheep . we are human beings , ' " she said . @entity1 was thankful for all the images being transmitted out of @entity3 despite the government 's crackdown on international journalists . she was thankful , too , that the world cared . " today , " she said , " i had this feeling of hope that things will finally change . "

@placeholder women have been slowly building a movement for greater rights
