( @entity0 ) -- he founded modern @entity2 . the boy who grew up herding cattle in the hills of the rural @entity7 area and attended a methodist missionary school where he was given the name " @entity10 " has dedicated his adult life to opposing the racist and segregationist policy of apartheid . @entity14 at first advocated peaceful opposition to white rule in early work with the @entity18 , a liberation movement . but the stubbornness of the apartheid regime increasingly frustrated him , until he turned to armed struggle shortly after the @entity23 in 1960 in which police killed some 69 black protesters , shooting many of them in the back . shortly after the protest the regime banned the @entity18 and another liberation movement , the @entity31 . in 1964 , @entity14 was sentenced to life imprisonment for carrying out acts of sabotage . in prison he became an international symbol of opposition to apartheid . over the decades that followed , as the movement against white rule in @entity2 began to grow and unrest inside the country became increasingly violent , it became clear to the white government that they could no longer continue to govern without consulting the @entity18 and , in particular , @entity14 . in the 1980s , @entity14 worked from prison to facilitate talks between the apartheid government and the @entity18 . he was unconditionally released from prison in 1990 , just days after the ban on the @entity18 and the @entity31 was lifted . after spending 27 years in prison , on his release @entity14 pursued a policy of reconciliation between black and white in @entity2 . many of the apartheid laws were repealed in the early ' 90s , but a few of the apartheid era laws are controversially still on the books . @entity14 became president of @entity2 in 1994 , but he stood for only one term before stepping down and continuing to foster national reconciliation . some have criticized @entity14 for placing too much emphasis on reconciliation and not transforming the country enough , but the vast majority of @entity2 revere his legacy and its meaning in the society they inhabit today . visitors to the stunning nation at the tip of the continent can retrace many of @entity14 's most significant moments , among them his release from prison 23 years ago , on february 11 , 1990 . @entity76 and surrounds @entity78 @entity78 is one of @entity2 's premier tourist destinations the ferry ride from the @entity76 waterfront alone is worth doing for the beautiful view of the city and @entity85 from the sea . but " the @entity78 , " as it was known during the days of apartheid , gives the visitor an eerie sense of desolation . to really understand @entity14 's struggle and the sacrifices he made for the freedom of his people , you need to take a tour of the prison where he was held . walking through the now silent empty jail cells , you bear witness to the loneliness and suffering he overcame to become a world icon of reconciliation . @entity104 ( @entity105 ) set incongruously in beautiful vineyards near @entity107 , the @entity105 is where @entity14 spent the last 14 months of his imprisonment . here he was treated with greater respect by the authorities and eventually was moved into the warden 's rather comfortable suburban house . shortly after his release , @entity14 built a house at @entity116 , his birthplace in the @entity7 , based on the layout of his prison lodgings . it has been said that the one thing he missed from his prison experience was the solitude and the chance to reflect , and the house reminds him of that feeling . @entity14 was released from @entity126 on february 11 , 1990 , and images were broadcast around the world of him and @entity129 walking hand - in - hand toward the crowds , their fists clenched . today , outside the main gate , there is a dramatic bronze statue of @entity14 that commemorates that event . stand on the road on the way to the prison gates and stop to imagine the excitement that erupted among the crowd in 1990 as @entity14 finally emerged after 27 years . @entity143 @entity144 now a fascinating small museum , @entity14 's old house in @entity146 in @entity147 in @entity144 shows just how black people lived under apartheid . even relatively well - to - do people like the young @entity14 , who was a lawyer , lived with their families in small four - room brick " matchbox " houses . @entity14 returned to this house a few days after he was released from prison , and many journalists interviewed him in the tiny garden , but after his release he never really lived there again . archbishop @entity161 lived here , too , just down the road , so it is the only street in the world where two @entity168 winners have lived in separate houses . up the hill from @entity14 's house is the @entity173 memorial and museum . this is the point where the famous @entity176 began on june 16 , 1976 , and where the iconic picture was taken of a dying @entity173 being carried while his sister ran crying alongside . the museum is excellent and well worth a visit . @entity181 while not only about @entity14 , this fascinating museum recreates what life was like for both black and white @entity2 under apartheid . it gives an excellent idea of what @entity14 and other activists were fighting against and of their ideals for the future . walking into the museum is an eerie experience as the entranceway is divided -- a gateway for blacks and a gateway for whites . it seems hard today to believe that such a system existed , but this museum lays it all out . @entity203 @entity203 is the site today of @entity2 's @entity204 , which is regarded as a post-modernist architectural icon . if you 're lucky , you might be able to listen in briefly on a constitutional hearing in the main chamber , and the court has a celebrated art collection . the older buildings have a more ominous history . built in 1892 under the old @entity218 , many of @entity2 's most famous political prisoners , including @entity216 war leaders , @entity14 and @entity217 , spent time in the @entity219 . a tour through the old prison gives you a sense of @entity2 's layered and complex past . @entity224 out in the northern suburbs of @entity226 is the famous @entity224 . it was some 12 miles outside the city in the 1960s and was purchased by the @entity229 with secret funds smuggled in from the @entity231 . @entity232 , a white communist , fronted as the owner of the farm while @entity14 , @entity236 and other prominent @entity18 activists hid from the police in the outbuildings . many political discussions were held in the main house and by 1963 , it was becoming clear to the @entity18 that they were putting themselves under too much risk . it was too late , on july 11 of that year , the police swooped in and arrested a number of top @entity18 leaders . @entity14 was already on @entity78 for a previous conviction when the raid happened , but many still say today that his gun was buried on the farm and lies somewhere hidden in the earth . @entity253 @entity256 if you are driving down to @entity255 from @entity226 , you might want to make a short visit to the site at @entity256 where @entity14 was arrested . set in the beautiful @entity260 , the spot is only a few minutes off the main highway , the @entity262 . though there 's not a great deal to see , a sculpture recently has been erected to mark the spot . an ongoing mystery is tied to the place , though , as some activists have said the @entity270 tipped off the @entity2 security forces , pinpointing @entity14 at this spot . no one has proved the claim , and it remains uncertain . @entity275 @entity116 @entity116 , on the @entity275 , is @entity14 's hometown . his house -- which you can not visit -- is right on the @entity279 between @entity255 and @entity280 . if you 're on the highway , the small museum at @entity116 is certainly worth a stop . if you find the right people at the museum , they will grab a small piece of plastic chair and you can slide down the vast curved rock that @entity14 slid down when he was a young boy playing hooky from his duties as a cattle herder . if you 're lucky and have the time , you may be able to sit with a group of elders and sip the local sorghum beer known as @entity297 . there is a tiny , reasonably priced bed and breakfast called @entity301 's where you can sleep in a typical @entity303 hut and try @entity303 food . the surrounding area is extremely poor but there are interesting things to see and do . @entity14 's life and legacy are layered into the life and landscape of @entity2 , and as the years go by , his stature grows .

@placeholder , where @entity14 was imprisoned , is one of @entity2 's top tourist destinations
