( @entity0 ) -- last june , @entity1 stunned fans when he revealed in a press release that he was suffering from alzheimer 's disease . it was not an easy decision to go public with his private struggle , but his family felt it was a decision that needed to be made . " the main thing we were concerned about was during shows he would forget a line or get a little confused , " says @entity1 's daughter , @entity10 . " people would think , ' is he drunk ? ' is he doing drugs again ? ' so we did n't want people to get the wrong impression . " but an interesting thing happened after the @entity22 's announcement . instead of fading off into the sunset like a forgotten icon , the 75 - year - old entertainer has been catapulted back into the spotlight -- and the music industry ca n't seem to shower him with enough accolades . in november , he was the subject of a star - studded tribute at the @entity32 show , and on sunday night , he 'll pick up a @entity33 at the @entity34 . behind the scenes , it 's been somewhat of a standoff between the @entity32 and the @entity38 , with each telecast vying for bragging rights to have @entity1 perform . but there 's nothing like the pull of the @entity38 -- especially when you 're a five - time @entity38 winner . at the @entity32 , @entity1 beamed from the audience while @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 serenaded him with his biggest hits , but the @entity38 will be a different story . @entity1 himself will take center stage for " rhinestone cowboy , " flanked by @entity55 , @entity56 and his own band -- which features three of his grown children . it 'll be his first live television performance since the @entity22 's diagnosis , and thus , it will also be a bit of a cliffhanger . last fall , @entity1 released his final album , " @entity64 , " then hit the road on what he 's calling his farewell tour . most of the time , he sails through his set like the charismatic veteran he is . three teleprompters at the foot of the stage enable him to read his lyrics , and when he flubs a line here or there , he usually laughs it off . but there are rare moments when he 'll become a little disoriented , and that 's when it helps that he 's surrounded by family on stage . @entity84 keeps things steady on drums , while his brother , @entity87 , plays guitar nearby . their younger sister , @entity10 , stands protectively to @entity1 's left , on keyboards , banjo and violin . " he looks at me sometimes if he is confused , and i just smile at him . i just try to make him feel like he is surrounded by people that love him on stage , " says @entity10 . while most people with @entity22 's drift in and out of lucidity without fanfare , you know exactly when @entity1 has hit a rough patch . he 'll be playing a song on guitar that he 's played a gazillion times , like " @entity107 , " then all of a sudden hit a bad chord or forget the lyrics . it 's like a light switch . in concert , fans are happy to fill in the gaps when he has a senior moment , singing his lyrics back at him until he finds his way again . @entity1 's wife , @entity119 , watches serenely from the soundboard , knowing full - well that these incidents will occur from time to time . but the whole family has made peace with it , including @entity1 . he tells @entity0 , " i am content with it . do n't cry over spilt milk . get up and be a man and do what you have got to do . " @entity0 recently sat down with @entity129 and @entity119 at their home in @entity131 , in a room overlooking the @entity134 coast . several guitars were on display within arm 's reach . others laid in cases in the entryway , ready to head out on the road . in another room , platinum and gold records lined the walls , documenting the success of " @entity107 , " " @entity149 " and " rhinestone cowboy . " clearly , music has been good to @entity1 , and @entity1 has been good for music . now , music is helping him cope with life . @entity0 : how does it feel to be receiving a @entity156 at the @entity38 ? @entity1 : i am flattered . i really am . all i wanted to do every since i could remember was play my guitar and sing . @entity0 : you came out to @entity160 in 1958 to be a guitarist . did you ever see yourself becoming a big star ? @entity1 : i never really thought of it ! i 'm a musician first . so when i got the job playing guitar with the session players , i said , " yay , i can play . " i was a little scared . i was a little nervous , but when i got in with @entity167 , i realized that i could cut it out here , and could do it . i played with the @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , the @entity174 , the @entity175 . @entity0 : you 're known as a great guitar player , but did you ever take a formal lesson ? @entity1 : no. i can read a chord chart , but i could n't read a note chart . @entity0 : are you nervous about taking the stage these days ? @entity1 : i realize you are going to make mistakes through life . just do n't make any bad ones , you know . like all of my records are perfect records , but i did make mistakes on them . i would rather do live than any kind of lip - synching or something like that . i do n't like to lip - synch . @entity0 : what has been the reaction from fans ? @entity198 : boy , were we pleasantly surprised . they have been more than understanding . they have really just been rooting him on . it is really encouraging . glen : i do n't see myself any different , though . i 'm forgetful . @entity119 : i actually think he is better than he was a year ago . i think that being out and performing all the time has something to do with it . music seems to be really good therapy for him . i do n't know if it is the vibrations . maybe they stimulate the brain . of course he is on some medications today that i think have been helping , too . so we are blessed to be living in a time when there are some treatments . there is no cure , but there are things that can help , and they are helping . glen : what did they diagnose me as ? @entity119 : @entity22 's . glen : @entity22 's . what is @entity22 's ? @entity119 : you start losing your memory and your ability to reason . glen : i just take it as it comes , you know . i know that i have a problem with that , but it does n't bother me . if you 're going to have it handed to you , you have got to take it , anyway . so that is the way i look at it . @entity0 : you went down to @entity245 for the @entity32 in november . seemed like you knew a lot of people there . glen : what is his name -- the one who married that long - legged girl ? @entity119 : @entity47 . glen : yeah , @entity47 . he is probably the best guitar player in @entity245 . @entity119 : and @entity48 . they are two of his favorites . glen : just incredible players . @entity0 : the two of you have been married nearly 30 years . did you really meet on a blind date ? @entity119 : i was dancing with the @entity261 at @entity262 . glen : they had a bunch lined up and i thought , " i 'll take that one there . " no , i 'm kidding . @entity0 : was it love at first sight ? @entity119 , at that time , he was kind of a hell - raiser . @entity119 : i really did n't know anything about that , because i was a dancer , and i just had my head into @entity274 and i did n't read the tabloids . but i knew he was a singer . and then i went to one of his concerts -- " oh my goodness , i remember that song . i remember that song . " he had a lot of hits . so then i got a little more intimidated , but i really just did n't know much about him . @entity0 : @entity129 , did @entity119 change your life ? glen : yes , she did change my life in many ways . before i met her , i did n't know where i was at , or where i was going . and after i met her , i knew where i was going , and i knew where to wanted to go . do everything according to @entity294 , and be nice , and treat other people the way you would like to be treated . we both go on that bit of advice there . @entity0 : you 've had your ups and downs . glen : i was forgiven for being a dummy , literally . i have been through so many changes . the first part of my career , everything was not in place . @entity0 : do you pray every morning ? glen : sometimes i do , sometimes i do n't . @entity0 : what do you ask for ? glen : mainly thanks . thank you , @entity315 , for letting me get up this morning . let me have a good day . and if you do n't , i will come up there and get you ! and he laughs at that .
