@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- on a foggy morning in @entity3 , one of this city 's most gilded neighborhoods , a silent standoff is taking place outside the mansion where pop music superstar @entity9 breathed his last breath . it has become a familiar ritual for the players : a burly man sits in a black suv parked in the driveway in front of a closed gate . across the street , a woman in a white jacket and fedora camps out in a lawn chair shaded by a beach umbrella , a cooler at her side . he watches her . she ignores him . a series of lime green placards saying " * hot @entity30 " leads drivers from the winding curves of @entity33 into this manicured oasis of wealth and privilege -- and to the woman locals call the @entity40 lady . her name is @entity42 , and she was on the corner of @entity33 and @entity44 long before @entity9 arrived . she remembers well the days when he stood on a balcony of the rented chateau - style mansion and tossed autographed pillows to screaming fans . she remembers that he ordered pizzas for them and that his father , @entity52 , would come visiting but would n't be let in . she also remembers the hordes that descended in june 2009 , when @entity9 died on the eve of his comeback concert tour . his doctor , @entity56 , was tasked with making sure the @entity9 stayed healthy and showed up for rehearsals . now he is on trial , accused of giving @entity9 a lethal dose of an anesthetic to help him sleep . on the weekend before the doctor went on trial for manslaughter , @entity44 was nearly deserted . despite the property 's notoriety and the looming criminal trial , there was no pilgrimage of @entity9 fans , not even a lone " looky - loo , " as people in @entity0 call curiosity seekers . it was just the security guard and the @entity40 lady . and the @entity74 lady was feeling shy . " i ca n't do an interview , " she said , bolting up from her lawn chair . she scurried to her white suv and drove off , leaving a taciturn assistant to deal with the nosy visitor . a third - generation purveyor of the dishy tourist maps , @entity80 has good reason to be skittish . the owners of the mansion , fashion executive @entity84 and his wife , @entity85 , have taken her to court . the homeowners filed suit in june , calling @entity80 's @entity40 business " a highly visible eyesore " and charging that she is tanking their property value . they are asking a judge for an injunction kicking the @entity40 lady off the corner . a hearing has been set for october 18 before judge @entity98 in @entity99 , according to the court file . @entity80 's family has sold @entity40 from the corner since the 1930s -- long before such things as tour buses , paparazzi and @entity107 . they survived past attempts to shut them down or make them move . and @entity80 has long been a @entity9 fan -- so much so that she traveled the 90 minutes to @entity112 a dozen times to attend his 2005 child molestation trial . she celebrated when he was acquitted . on august 28 , the eve of what would have been the pop star 's 53rd birthday , @entity80 was chattier when she received a visit from a crew with " @entity122 , " a show that features @entity56 's trial and other court cases and airs daily on @entity1 's sister network , @entity122 . @entity9 could have lived anywhere in the world , she said , but he chose the mansion on her @entity40 corner as he prepped for his " @entity131 " tour . " it came alive in a way no other place came alive through the years of map selling or that kind of thing , " she says . " it 's @entity139 . really , nobody lived there except @entity142 , a while ago . " the fans came because @entity9 engaged them , she said . and then there was the live music that poured out of the house every time @entity9 practiced in his studio , which was often . " we all heard the music that came out from behind those walls , " @entity80 said . " so a lot of fans would park their cars here . they were trying to hear the music , but they did n't really tell a whole lot of people because they did n't want @entity9 to stop playing . so we had the time of our lives . this was actually the biggest thrill we 'll ever have . the music was absolutely beautiful . " she was on her corner on june 25 , 2009 , when an ambulance took @entity9 away . although he usually went to @entity166 , the ambulance turned right , toward @entity167 , she recalled . it was followed by several dark @entity169 , and she suspected something was seriously wrong . she says a @entity1 producer told her that @entity9 had died , and soon hundreds of weeping fans came . she gave her maps away then , telling people , " @entity9 would n't want you to cry . " even now , she says , " it 's like a tourist magnet . it 's like a historical landmark that 's not quite noted as one , but everybody knows where it is . it 's the first place people really want to see when they get off that plane . " @entity80 says many people who stop do n't even buy a map . they just want to know where @entity9 's last home is . the homeowners ' lawsuit makes no mention of their most famous tenant or the notoriety of the address . as far as the lawsuit is concerned , @entity198 's @entity40 business is what draws the gawkers . the legal action opens a new chapter in an age - old @entity0 story , rekindling tensions that can arise in a city built on the culture of fame and populated by people eager to cash in on the fantasy . the case also pits two of @entity214 's most cherished values -- individual property rights and free speech -- against each other . " it is unpleasant and inconvenient to constantly be forced to navigate illegally stopped traffic in front of the plaintiffs ' home and to be daily and frequently forced to view defendant 's business activity , " the lawsuit states . the couple is trying to sell the mansion and , the lawsuit charges , @entity80 's presence is hurting their chances . " the property is made unattractive , " the suit charges . " potential buyers are bothered upon approach by the quite visible and annoying constant illegal stopping and / or parking of cars in front of the home that would otherwise be on a quiet residential street . " @entity80 , who is representing herself , considers the lawsuit " harassment " and argues in her court papers that the law was settled decades ago in her favor . her mother fought similar attempts by the city of @entity0 to shut down her @entity40 business through the 1970s . she took the fight all the way to the @entity214 @entity254 . a copy of the court 's 1978 opinion is included in the court file as @entity42 's response to the most recent lawsuit . according to the opinion and several newspaper clippings attached to it , @entity80 's grandfather obtained a copyright during the 1930s for what would become the oldest continuously published map of the places where the stars live , shop and eat . her mother , @entity272 , ran the family business for 40 years before handing it down to her daughter , who has been hawking the @entity40 for more than two decades . it was during @entity272 's watch that the epic court battle was waged . the city of @entity0 declared her stand , on a grassy corner at @entity33 and @entity281 , a public nuisance under the municipal code and obtained a court injunction in 1973 . she fought it on freedom - of - speech grounds , but the city contended that she was engaged in commercial activity not protected by the @entity289 . she lost the first round , appealed , and five years later , the case wound up before the @entity214 @entity254 , which struck down the city 's ordinance , saying it was unconstitutional . " battling public nuisance can not be pursued by means infringing personal liberties when less restrictive alternatives are available , " the court found . attorney @entity300 , who filed the 2011 lawsuit , was in trial in another case and was too busy to talk about the @entity40 case , an assistant said . but the @entity306 ' civil suit is likely to fail because it cites the ordinance that already has been struck down by a higher court , said @entity310 , a @entity289 attorney in @entity0 . " once a court has found an ordinance to be unconstitutional , it sort of follows , as night follows day , that one can not invoke the same ordinance and seek to have it enforced , " @entity310 said . and , he noted , last month , a federal appeals court struck down a similar ordinance in nearby @entity317 , which sought to stop day laborers from soliciting employment on public streets . whatever happens in court , the scene on the corner of @entity33 and @entity44 has already changed . the man and his music are gone . but not the @entity40 lady . not yet , anyway . @entity327 is a senior producer with " @entity122 , " which airs weekdays on @entity122 , @entity1 's sister network .

@entity80 's mother won a similar court battle with the @placeholder in the 1970s
