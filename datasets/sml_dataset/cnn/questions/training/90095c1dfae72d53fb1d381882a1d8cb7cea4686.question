( @entity0 ) -- most kids , and parents , think of college as the place you go to get a " higher education . " it did n't turn out that way for at least 3,100 students at the @entity10 . @entity0 reporter @entity11 has been reporting the story out of @entity13 , @entity14 , that university staff and athletic coaches encouraged student athletes to take " fake classes " in order to get fake grades that would allow them to keep playing sports and spend their extra time practicing instead of studying . university staff saw so - called paper classes and the artificially inflated grades they handed out " as key to helping some student - athletes remain eligible , " a former prosecutor wrote in an independent report documenting 18 years of such cheating . @entity0 reports at least four @entity10 employees have been fired and five have been disciplined in the scandal . " as an athlete , we were n't really there for an education , " @entity34 , the second - leading scorer on the championship @entity10 basketball team 10 years ago , told @entity0 's @entity36 . " you get a scholarship to the university to play basketball , " he said . in other words , the point was n't for him to actually learn . that 's just sad . " the university makes money off us athletes , " @entity34 told @entity36 , " and they give us this fake education as a distraction . " when @entity55 first made these remarks , university representatives tried to shoot the messenger , attacking him and his credibility . now , an official report suggests that not only was @entity55 telling the truth but that at least 3,100 other students share his story . and i think it 's safe to assume that while the degree of inventing classes from thin air in order to pass athletes may have reached extreme levels of immorality , if not criminality , at @entity10 , thousands and thousands of other student athletes have been robbed of a quality education at universities all across @entity78 because their bodies are treated as far more important than their minds . players and their loved ones are understandably angry . in march , @entity84 's scholarship football players won the right under the @entity86 to form a union . players voted in april , though the results have not yet been made public . if the union vote succeeds by a majority vote , the athletes could be covered by workers ' compensation , qualify for unemployment benefits and even participate in revenue sharing . as is , football players are practicing 50 to 60 hours a week — more than most full - time jobs — and risking all kinds of long - term health effects , not the least of which are head injuries . in rare cases , players who are hurt can have their scholarships revoked and lose access to whatever paltry education they were receiving in the first place . these kids , many of whom are young black men , are plainly being exploited . as the hype around college sports has intensified — especially the astronomical money to be made by universities in increasingly lucrative tv deals — universities have gained more and more from sports programs . meanwhile , the demands on student athletes have risen as well , but the compensation and support for athletes have remained the same . college sports increasingly look just like professional sports except for one big difference : the amateurish , abusive treatment of college athletes . not surprisingly , universities and their athletic departments oppose college players forming unions . " i look at them as part of our family in a way , " @entity133 football coach @entity132 told @entity134 around the time of the @entity84 vote . " we 're here to support them and help them in every way possible , and help guide them and help them get their education and develop them to be as good of athletes as they want to be . " family , eh ? that 's a coded metaphor : the coach and university as the strong parents , the students as kids who should just be grateful for a roof over their heads and do whatever they 're told . how does that play out in real life ? one study found that 10 % of @entity133 athletes in sports that make revenue read below a fourth - grade level . " college presidents have put in jeopardy the academic credibility of their universities just so we can have this entertainment industry , " @entity133 professor @entity168 , who conducted the study , told @entity0 . that " entertainment industry " seems to be working fine for the pseudo " parents " who run college sports . this season , coach @entity181 will be paid $ 5.25 million . it 's not looking likely that my own daughter , who is in first grade , will eventually get a sports scholarship to college . she 's still trying to figure out her left foot from her right foot . but if she gets a music scholarship or a drama scholarship or maybe some recognition for macrame skills or what have you , i fully expect that her talent will be fully drawn upon while she 's at college — but also that she 'll get an education . after all , most @entity202 horn players do n't go on to careers in professional orchestras — they become doctors or lawyers or accountants or elementary school teachers . and for that , they need an education . the same is true of college athletes . the vast majority wo n't play post-college professional sports , and they need that education , not just a nominal version but a quality one , to prepare for later in life . my view is that elite college athletes should form unions . there are plenty of practical reasons why , as effective athletic employees , they should do so . but at the very least , the basic bargain of college scholarship sports — that you play on the team in exchange for an education — should n't be a con game , with students worked to the bone but robbed of the chance to learn . let 's hope the revelations at @entity10 will help start to fix this profound problem in college athletics .
