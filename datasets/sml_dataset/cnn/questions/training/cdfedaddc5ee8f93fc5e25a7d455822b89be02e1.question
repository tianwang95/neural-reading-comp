( @entity0 ) -- location , location , location : it matters greatly to the success of democracy . last week , for the second time in a decade , a popular uprising in @entity8 chased away a corrupt , authoritarian leader . ( the same leader both times , as it happens . ) the @entity13 of 2005 ended badly -- and the same adverse conditions overshadow @entity8 's hopes today . yet in @entity8 , neighbors @entity17 and @entity18 have supported and defended that nation 's dissidents and democrats . but @entity8 is not the only authoritarian regime facing protests . and it 's not the only nation where democratic neighbors could make a positive difference . unfortunately , in the other case -- @entity30 -- too many of those neighbors are silent . except only for brief punctuations by rebellions and invasions , @entity31 ruled @entity8 as a province from the late 17th century until 1991 . @entity36 seems to regard the state of affairs since 1991 as merely another of those punctuations . under @entity36 , @entity31 has subverted @entity8 institutions and manipulated the @entity8 economy . the goal has been to subordinate @entity8 as a dependent , compliant and nondemocratic subject state . @entity36 succeeded in that goal after 2005 . he 'll surely try again after 2014 . whether he succeeds again or is thwarted will depend greatly on the efforts of @entity17 and @entity18 above all . those neighbors exemplify the transition to democracy and a normally functioning economy . the @entity17 foreign minister was in @entity51 during the crucial hours before the flight of president @entity53 . @entity18 has offered aid to cover @entity8 's energy debt to @entity31 and has warned @entity31 against any tampering with @entity8 's territorial integrity . in @entity30 , at least eight people are dead and dozens wounded in protests . many of the casualties have been inflicted by semicriminal motorcycle gangs known as colectivos , loyal to the @entity66 regime , so - called because @entity67 helped change the official name of the country to @entity70 of @entity30 . the @entity71 has been turned off in cities sympathetic to the opposition , both to stop information arriving -- and , maybe even more , to prevent photos and videos of regime brutality from exiting . @entity80 's cable news network has been dropped from @entity30 cable systems . @entity0 has been threatened with the same fate unless it alters its coverage more to the authorities ' liking . @entity0 has not complied , and thus far the @entity30 government has not executed its threat . @entity88 has sent troops to reinforce the government . in this dangerous situation , the presidents of @entity91 and @entity80 have urged the @entity30 government to permit peaceful protest and eschew violence . these statements carry impressive moral weight . @entity91 is @entity98 's outstanding democratic paragon . since the end of the dictatorship in 1989 , power has alternated from democratic right to democratic left and back again . outstanding economic management has led @entity91 to the highest per - capita income in @entity98 , catching up to @entity106 and @entity107 , and ahead of @entity17 . @entity80 has made impressive progress subduing a decades - long insurgency and inviting former rebels to join the political progress under the new and more liberal constitution of 1990 . it has suppressed drug trafficking : aerial surveys indicate @entity80 's coca acreage has been reduced by three - fourths since 2000 . president @entity118 has hailed @entity80 president @entity119 as " bold and brave " in his work for peace and security inside @entity80 -- a task made more complex and difficult by the @entity125 's military and financial support for the drug - trafficking remnants of the @entity80 insurgency . because the presidents of @entity91 and @entity80 are identified with the political right , however , their condemnation is easier for the @entity30 government to shrug off than would be condemnations from democratic presidents associated with @entity136 's democratic left . @entity138 's @entity137 could play an especially important part here . herself once a left - wing guerrilla against @entity138 's former military regime , @entity137 embraced democratic politics in the 1970s and 1980s and was chief of staff to president @entity144 , a former trade unionist and @entity138 's first president of working - class origins . @entity144 was everything that @entity67 pretended to be , a leader who promoted social welfare policies while also respecting basic freedoms and civil rights . unlike @entity67 , who started his political career with a failed coup , @entity144 always followed constitutional rules . again , unlike @entity67 who repeatedly rewrote @entity30 's laws to extend his hold on power , he left by the constitutional timetable . as @entity144 's successor , @entity137 inherits much of his prestige . yet that moral voice keeps silent as @entity30 's goon government exerts ever more censorship , corruption and violence to extend its grip on power . the authoritarian governments of @entity136 -- not only @entity30 but also @entity88 , @entity169 , and @entity170 -- form almost a trade union of shared ugly interests . where is the unity of the continent 's democracies ? for very understandable historical reasons , @entity136 governments worry about overbearing @entity136 action . yet many wo n't act , even when their most important interests and most cherished values come under violent attack . the leaders of @entity18 and @entity17 have learned from history that embattled democrats , when left alone , may die alone . the lessons apply as well in the @entity188 as in the @entity189 -- the lessons and the responsibility . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .
