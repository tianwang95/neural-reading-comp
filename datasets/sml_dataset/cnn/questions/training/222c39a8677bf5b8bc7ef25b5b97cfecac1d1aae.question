( @entity0 ) -- when @entity2 pulls the veil off of its newest store on friday , @entity1 will get their first glimpse at the classical architecture - meets - computers retail space inside @entity7 . behind a temporary black facade , which has teased commuters for weeks with " arriving soon " messages , @entity2 has been negotiating aggressively and stealthily with contractors and government agencies to quickly secure a favorable deal . the @entity7 outlet is just one of several high - profile stores the company has been readying with characteristic covertness . interviews with nearly two dozen people involved in the development of upcoming and recently opened @entity23 @entity22 , including the one in @entity7 , provide a look at @entity2 's unusually furtive way of doing business . these people say @entity2 sometimes employs uncommon legal tactics , refuses to name itself in public documents and hearings , and has sworn city government officials to secrecy . @entity2 's shrewd negotiating tactics are well known in other parts of its business . nondisclosure agreements are strictly enforced with employees , contractors and partners , and punishment for disloyalty is swift and unforgiving . for example , employees who leak internal memos may be fired as soon as they are discovered . when prototype iphones were lost in bars in two consecutive years , police officers searched the homes of people suspected of possessing them . but retail chains , especially those that sell electronics , are n't typically associated with controversy . and retail industry executives say @entity2 's demands for absolute secrecy in its store - development process are peculiar and unjustified . an @entity2 spokeswoman declined to comment for this story . ' @entity2 is not typical ' as buzz grew about work on a @entity7 @entity22 , the @entity60 , which controls the station , spurned many interview requests -- even months after the store was unveiled at a public meeting in july . a @entity66 editorial published in august lamented that procuring any details about the project " was like trying to uncover a state secret . " when reached by phone in october , @entity60 spokeswoman @entity70 told @entity0 in response to a question about the soon - to - open @entity22 , " we 're not talking about that . " why ? " because @entity2 does n't want us to . " is this typical ? " no , but @entity2 is not typical , " @entity76 said . further questions , she said , would need to be submitted in a formal @entity80 request , a government process that can take months to yield documents . @entity7 is a historic landmark , meaning each project must go through an approval process . @entity2 asked for its architects to deal directly with @entity1 's @entity87 -- a role that 's supposed to be handled by the @entity60 -- so the process was completed promptly , said @entity90 , a director for @entity1 's @entity87 . similar maneuvers are being used at other stores . officials in @entity94 , @entity95 , referred questions about a new @entity22 to the city 's formal public - records division . they offered two brief reports , one of which @entity2 did not list its name on . " we generally do n't talk about our customers , " said @entity94 spokeswoman @entity102 in a phone interview in september . " we 're obviously glad that @entity2 is here and hope they will stay for a long time . " at a shopping mall in the @entity111 suburb of @entity112 , @entity113 , where @entity2 already has a store , the computer company is opening a new one on the floor above , where clothing and jewelry stores used to be , according to public documents . the current @entity22 is near a @entity119 , which opened last year and has more floor space . continuing the high - stakes game of one - upmanship , the new @entity22 is even larger , and from the balcony in front , customers can look down on @entity119 's shop . there have been whispers about this brewing battle just miles from @entity119 's headquarters , but people involved in the project are not authorized to speak publicly about it . @entity134 , an executive for @entity135 , the @entity137 mall developer , declined to comment . the mysterious black barricade around the store 's large perimeter says only that a new store is coming in the spring of next year . @entity2 leverages success in retail @entity22 were conceived as a way for @entity2 to promote its entire smorgasbord of products and to control their presentation . typically sleek and minimalistic with uncluttered display counters and no cash registers , each store is a representation of the @entity2 brand . first opened in 2001 , the stores have risen as a financial anomaly in the struggling physical - retail industry . in just a decade , @entity2 has opened 357 stores worldwide . in the @entity23 , its shops generate by far the highest sales per square foot -- a coveted statistic in retail -- with $ 5,626 on average , according to industry research firm @entity164 . in a recent financial disclosure , @entity2 said it plans to spend about $ 900 million for retail facilities next year . " @entity2 has enormous momentum , and nowhere is that more evident than in our retail stores , " @entity2 ceo @entity168 said during the first few minutes of an october news conference to unveil the @entity170 . " we will continue to invest in more and more stores , and raise the bar in retail . " in that speech , @entity168 emphasized @entity2 's growth in @entity178 . the @entity180 store that opened last year is a breathtaking glass cylinder . while in its planning phases , the late @entity2 co-founder @entity182 personally convinced the developer of the surrounding plaza to revise its own construction plans to make the @entity22 the centerpiece , the @entity66 reported . for that october article , architect @entity188 spoke in depth with the @entity66 about his work designing @entity22 . he mentioned that he is working on several stores that will look like the one on @entity1 's @entity193 , which has a tall glass entrance that stretches up to an all - glass ceiling . but when @entity0 reached out to @entity188 for comment shortly after the @entity66 report , a spokeswoman for his firm , @entity197 , said , " @entity2 has requested that we refrain from granting any additional interviews . " in many cases , @entity2 's secrecy and strong - arm negotiating has paid off . the increasingly mighty company has managed to secure leases without standard revenue - sharing provisions and has flown through some lengthy public - approval systems . but that may have backfired last week , when the @entity7 @entity22 found its way into the spotlight for reasons other than its attractive layout . @entity214 , the state 's comptroller , announced that his office would expedite an audit of the @entity60 's lease with @entity2 . audits are common and can take at least two months , but @entity214 moved up the review in response to a @entity224 report about @entity2 being the only retailer in @entity7 that wo n't be paying a percentage of sales to the cash - strapped @entity60 , a comptroller official said . @entity60 spokesman @entity228 cited @entity2 's corporate policy , which says it will not cut revenue - sharing agreements for stores . what @entity60 got out of the deal is @entity2 's willingness to pay $ 5 million to buy out a struggling restaurant 's lease for that space , and the company 's agreement not to significantly modify the station 's historic architecture , he said . the new @entity22 , which employs 315 people , will inevitably drive new shoppers to neighboring retailers and to the @entity60 , which takes a percentage from everyone else 's sales , @entity228 said . @entity2 's negotiators , along with most retail executives , are well aware of that fact . no doubt it was a powerful bargaining token .
