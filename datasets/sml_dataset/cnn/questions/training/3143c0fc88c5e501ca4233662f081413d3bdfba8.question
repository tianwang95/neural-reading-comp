( @entity0 ) -- fans of crime fiction know the names @entity3 and @entity5 well . two @entity6 . two generations . two masters of their craft . at 56 years old , @entity3 is the established veteran . a former reporter for the @entity12 , he 's won every award given to mystery writers . his books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and been translated into 39 languages . later this year @entity3 marks an important milestone in his career . his best known character , @entity21 detective @entity20 , returns in " @entity22 , " @entity3 's 25th novel in 20 years . the other @entity24 is @entity5 , also an award - winning and best - selling author . you could call him the future of crime fiction . @entity5 has published nine novels since 2004 , and he 's just shy of 30 years old . his latest , " @entity35 , " a tale of faith , football and revenge recently debuted on the @entity31 bestseller list and is getting rave reviews from fans and critics . the two @entity6 visited @entity40 last week for the @entity41 , one of the largest literary get - togethers in the country . @entity0 had a chance to sit down with the two authors to compare notes and get some insight into their highly - successful writing careers . the following is an edited transcript . @entity0 : you 're both reaching new milestones in your careers , how does it feel ? @entity5 : i feel like i 'm exactly a decade behind @entity3 . he 's at twenty years in publishing , i 'm at ten . when i came in there were a group of writers who are standard bearers . you look at what they 're doing and think this is what i have to go chase . the first book i wrote that was published , my editor was telling me go read @entity3 . i said " i am " and he said , " try again . " ten years later i 'm still getting that advice from everyone . what @entity3 's been able to sustain for twenty years is almost unprecedented in terms of the quality of the books continuing to improve . it 's just remarkable . hopefully my books are improving . one of the ways i find motivation to improve is looking at someone who is already at a high level and continues to get better with each book . that 's really what you want to emulate . @entity3 : i do n't think i was one who looked at anniversaries and numbers much , but for some reason this one was significant for me . when you 're starting out you never believe that you might accomplish writing twenty - five books in twenty years . it 's really bizarre to even contemplate . twenty years was significant as well because of what happened in @entity95 in 1992 . my first book was published in january of that year so it was kind of a new world opening up to me . a few months later the city was torn apart by riots after the @entity103 trial . i really did weigh all these anniversaries and years when writing this book . i think it 's the first time i ever really thought about that . the book 's about the death of a journalist and during the riots i almost got killed . that 's something i worked out in a lot of my books . so that all played into it , there 's a lot of nostalgia , all of it was really important to me and i never really had this kind of stuff inspiring me before . @entity0 : how have you both remained so prolific ? @entity3 : what @entity5 has done is remarkable . my first book was n't published until i was 36 . now he 's almost thirty and on his ninth book . you know i 'm bragging about how i 'm on book 25 and he 's probably thinking about 75 . that 's hard for me to imagine , what he 's doing . i feel like i 'm making up for lost time . that 's part of what drives me . for some reason , i do n't know why i had this idea , maybe because i was 36 when my first book was published , but i wanted to write 36 books before i 'm done . i love the play " @entity141 . " in the movie , @entity143 says , " always be closing . " i feel the same way . for me closing is writing , always be doing it . @entity5 : i knew at a young age this is what i wanted to do . i look at the fact that i got an early start -- that was a real blessing to me because it gave me a greater opportunity to tell more stories , hopefully , and at the end of the day that 's what i want to do . what i love is the writing , it 's not having written . i like the process of it . @entity0 : do you view writing as a competition or camaraderie ? @entity5 : i 've always felt an incredible amount of generosity from the time i showed up , people going out of their way to help me who did n't have to . it seems like there 's a really good spirit of brotherhood , especially in crime fiction . in terms of competition , anytime i read a book that i think is really good , like " @entity22 , " i love it and i 'm rooting for @entity3 as a friend but there 's also a spark of , this is a better book than what i wrote and now i 've got to try and catch up with that . for me , that 's the greatest motivation to improve is to see really good writers continue to get better and continue to pull farther away from you . you 're always chasing the rabbit , and that 's a good thing . @entity3 : there 's always been a good mix of camaraderie and motivation . we 're lucky in the genre we pursue , it 's so big . we 're not worried about , that book is so good it 's going to take sales away from me . you just do n't see that . readers love to read good stuff , so there 's no reason to really be competitive . @entity0 : do you prefer writing a stand alone novel or a continuing series character ? @entity5 : what i like about writing a stand alone novel is you 're starting with a fresh world and fresh characters . part of what i love about writing is that journey of discovery where it 's all new to me as well . this is my fourth stand alone in a row and i am beginning to get a little bit of an itch now to take a longer ride with a character , to get to know them a little better . in " @entity35 " i really fell in love with those characters , there was an emotional connection there that i do n't think i 've had in a while . it made me think it would be nice to stick with the characters for a little bit and see what happens . my next book will be a stand alone but after that i 'm thinking about trying to take a little bit longer ride . @entity3 : a series character like @entity20 can be a trap but it 's a good trap to be in . this idea that it 's an unfinished story with more to say . i guess i never write standalones . even if i come up with a new character , i often bring them back . the last time i introduced a new character was " @entity248 , " and now that 's going on seven or eight years . i 'm already writing my next book and it 's @entity250 , but i kind of feel like creatively i need to come up with something new pretty soon . @entity0 : if you could steal an idea from the other @entity3 what would it be ? @entity3 : i would be an esoteric thief . maybe it 's the comfort of age but i look at what @entity3 has done with writing different kinds of genres . i 've been more straight laced , straight crime . i 've never broken away ; all my stuff is in the same vein . it takes a certain amount of courage and confidence to pop out a book that 's going to be compared to @entity269 instead of @entity270 . so i would steal that kind of creative courage . @entity5 : courage is one word for it . @entity275 might be another . i 've been shamelessly stealing from @entity3 for years . it 's his ability to say so much with one simple sentence that has what i call layers of depth . it 's the words beneath the words . he does that every book , time after time after time . he 'll lay out a beautiful line , @entity287 thinking on the surface what is a very simple thought or observation but it has ripples to the past , the present and goes deeper to the core of the character . he has the ability and the confidence to let it ride on top and know that the reader will get it and feel that impact . that 's an incredible gift and that 's just great writing .

@placeholder has published nine novels since 2004 and he 's just shy of 30 years old
