do n't mess with @entity1 . that was president @entity4 's message on friday , the same day a @entity6 government source claimed that @entity1 troops had significantly ratcheted up their military incursion into @entity9 . @entity11 does n't want or intend to wade into any " large - scale conflicts , " @entity4 insisted at a youth forum , state - run @entity10 reported . a few breaths later , he made the point that @entity1 is " strengthening our nuclear deterrence forces and our armed forces , " making them more efficient and modernized . " i want to remind you that @entity1 is one of the most powerful nuclear nations , " the president said . " this is a reality , not just words . " he later warned , " we must always be ready to repel any aggression against @entity1 and ( potential enemies ) should be aware ... it is better not to come against @entity1 as regards a possible armed conflict . " the comments came the same day that foreign minister @entity33 accused @entity34 of using " images from computer games " to -- in his view -- falsely make the case that @entity1 troops are in @entity9 . @entity33 said " hiding the evidence is an outstanding characteristic of the @entity41 and many @entity43 countries " with regard to @entity9 . see the @entity34 satellite images the thing is , many in the @entity48 do n't believe much of anything coming out of @entity1 . @entity51 spokesman @entity50 said friday that -- whatever the @entity53 says -- the reality is @entity1 troops are inside the @entity9 and have fired on @entity9 military positions . " those denials are completely without credibility , " @entity50 said . and @entity1 's military may be digging in deeper in @entity9 . the @entity6 government source told @entity59 on friday that @entity1 has moved 4,000 to 5,000 military personnel -- a figure far higher than one @entity41 official 's earlier claim of 1,000 troops . the soldiers are aligned in " formed units " and fighting around @entity67 and @entity68 , said the @entity6 source . and they may soon have company : some 20,000 troops are on border and " more may be on the way , " the source adds . so what 's @entity1 's endgame ? does it simply want to protect civilians or ethnic @entity1 in @entity9 ? or does it endeavor to develop a land bridge between @entity82 -- which split from @entity9 to become part of @entity1 months ago , amid the unrest following president @entity86 's ouster -- and the @entity1 border ? or perhaps take over all of @entity9 now ? the @entity6 source , giving his government 's analysis of @entity1 troop movements , surmised that right now " the primary role of the current @entity1 deployments inside @entity9 is probably to assist , support and take the pressure off the separatist forces in order to maintain pressure on @entity98 to decentralize . " however , we are not ruling out more ambitious plans , including a land corridor from the @entity1 border to @entity82 . " after 8 months of conflict , what 's next for @entity9 ? @entity34 chief blasts @entity1 's ' hollow denials ' @entity9 has been in crisis since last fall , when political upheaval preceded widespread violence that threatened to tear the @entity111 nation apart . if anything , that violence has worsened the past several months -- as @entity114 rebels dug in and @entity9 's military stepped up its offensive to retake its territory . the @entity120 human rights office reports at least 2,593 people killed between mid-april and august 27 , and that many innocent civilians have been killed , hurt or trapped in urban areas . predictably , both sides have taken the high road while blaming each other for humanitarian crisis and for perpetrating violence rather than having fair , sincere negotiations toward a cease - fire . " when @entity98 said that negotiations would begin only after the surrender of those whom they call ' separatists , ' the militia are left with no choice but to defend their homes , their families , " @entity1 's foreign ministry said in a statement . @entity143 officials say that @entity11 has n't taken any responsibility , whether for its military 's on - the - ground involvement or how it can influence rebels . speaking after a meeting of @entity34 ambassadors in @entity151 , @entity152 , secretary - general @entity148 said what he called " the serious escalation of @entity1 's military aggression against @entity9 " violates @entity9 's territorial integrity and " defies all diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution . " " despite @entity11 's hollow denials , it is now clear that @entity1 troops and equipment have illegally crossed the border into eastern and southeastern @entity9 , " @entity148 said . " this is not an isolated action but part of a dangerous pattern over many months to destabilize @entity9 as a sovereign nation . " fighting raging on multiple fronts whoever is to blame , whoever is involved , two things that are not in question is that the fighting is continuing and that there 's no end in sight . @entity9 troops have been fighting on two fronts : southeast of rebel - held @entity68 , and along the nation 's southern coast in the town of @entity184 , about 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) from the @entity1 border . @entity186 , deputy commander of the @entity9 @entity188 battalion , on thursday described the fighting in the south as " a full - scale invasion . " analysts suggest that @entity1 may have sent its forces into @entity194 to secure a land route from the border to the @entity82 peninsula it annexed from @entity9 in march , and in order to throw @entity9 forces making gains against besieged rebel forces in the cities of @entity68 and @entity67 off balance . in a statement issued by the @entity53 , @entity4 said the rebels had halted a @entity9 military operation in eastern @entity9 that he said had endangered the civilian population and caused many casualties . the @entity6 government source said @entity1 forces are fighting alongside rebels around @entity67 and @entity68 . it 's too early to gauge their impact , though even if propping up the @entity114 separatists for months longer so that @entity9 's military does n't next turn its attention to taking back @entity82 could be considered a victory . " at the very least , the @entity1 deployments are creating the conditions for a frozen conflict going into winter and ... ensure that @entity98 is sufficiently distracted ... to prevent it from refocusing its attention on @entity82 , " the source said . retired lt. gen. @entity225 , a 37 - year veteran who once commanded @entity41 soldiers in @entity111 , thinks that @entity1 may be aiming higher than that . if @entity9 folds easily to @entity1 's military might , neighboring nations might have good reason to worry . on the other side , @entity11 could lose sway if its efforts fail . " he is trying to influence the @entity237 , and it wo n't stop just with @entity9 , " the military analyst told @entity59 , predicting more @entity1 military intervention elsewhere . " this is something where he is trying to counter the influence of the @entity48 , and he ca n't afford to lose in @entity9 .
