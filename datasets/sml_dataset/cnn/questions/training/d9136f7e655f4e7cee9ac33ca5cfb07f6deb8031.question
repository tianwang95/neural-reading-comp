@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- clashes intensified wednesday in @entity1 's @entity4 as @entity1 forces launched aerial strikes on militants in response to a series of attacks by masked gunmen on military checkpoints . @entity1 army @entity14 helicopters fired rockets at armed militants , and there were numerous casualties , said gen. @entity19 , head of @entity4 security . state - run @entity21 reported that aerial strikes killed at least 20 in the port town of @entity0 . the assault came after masked gunmen launched six simultaneous attacks in @entity4 early wednesday , wounding five security officers and a civilian . the targets included five security checkpoints and a military cement factory , he said . @entity1 's military leadership , the @entity33 , issued a statement wednesday saying that the operation targeting " armed terrorist elements " in @entity4 " has accomplished this task with complete success . " two security sources who did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media told @entity2 that militants are concentrated in @entity42 in @entity43 . they are armed with rocket - propelled grenades , anti-aircraft guns and other weapons , including landmines , the sources said . security forces had failed in previous attempts to enter what is referred to as " @entity53 , " the sources said . but air assaults , which began tuesday night and were continuing wednesday , killed many of the militants , they said . still , land mines and the potential for ambushes made it difficult to enter the area using ground vehicles , they said . @entity64 , the governor of @entity65 , declared a state of emergency in all state sectors in the province , including a reduction in the number of tourist buses in order to ensure vehicles servicing tourists will be guarded . a political shakeup occurred amid the violence . the state - run @entity77 said the governor of @entity80 was sacked and a new general intelligence agency head chosen after his predecessor received an " early " retirement . the violence , which comes days after another attack in @entity4 , is a foreign policy test for @entity1 's new government and its president , @entity86 , a former longtime leader in the @entity88 's political movement , over its relations with @entity90 . islamists such as the @entity88 and many other @entity1 abhor @entity90 and its peace treaty with @entity1 . @entity90 , which borders @entity4 , raised concerns about terrorism in the region after @entity1 president @entity96 was ousted last year . @entity86 's " response to this crisis will provide the first real evidence of his oft - stated commitment to foreign diplomats that he will respect @entity1 's international agreements , that is , maintain the peace treaty with @entity90 , " said @entity101 and @entity102 , analysts with the @entity98 , a @entity100 - based think tank . @entity1 's president condemns deadly attack in @entity4 they wrote that assessment a day after 16 @entity1 soldiers were killed and seven wounded when assailants with semi-automatic weapons and hand grenades stole two armored vehicles from @entity1 forces and tried to enter @entity90 . the attack , which took place sunday near the @entity125 border crossing , prompted @entity1 to block hundreds of smuggling tunnels into the @entity128 territory of @entity129 , @entity19 said . the @entity1 government shut the @entity125 border " indefinitely " after the attack . @entity90 blamed militants associated with the group @entity134 for the sunday attack . @entity1 military officials called the assailants " enemies " of the nation , while the @entity88 said the @entity90 intelligence agency @entity140 was behind the killings . no group has claimed responsibility for the attack . @entity90 has handed over the charred remains of six assailants to @entity1 , and the remains have been transferred to the @entity148 in @entity149 for dna tests in an attempt to identify the perpetrators , according to @entity153 . a source close to the @entity1 military operation in northern @entity4 who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media told @entity2 of coordination between @entity1 and @entity90 authorities to permit the use " of combat helicopters and hundreds of additional troops in the demilitarized zone on the @entity1 side . " " according to the @entity166 , both sides must agree before allowing additional troops on either side of the borders . @entity90 agreed to allow @entity1 to move hundreds of additional troops into the @entity170 for the second time since the january 2011 uprising that toppled @entity96 , " the source said . @entity174 secretary of state @entity173 warned last month during her visit to @entity1 that the desert border between @entity90 and @entity1 could become an " operational base " for jihadists if security is not maintained . in an interview with @entity2 , @entity180 said the problem was discussed during her meetings in @entity1 and @entity90 . there is " the potential of jihadists and terrorists taking up an operational base in @entity4 , " @entity180 said in the interview . " we think this is a dangerous situation for both @entity1 and @entity90 . it is also dangerous for @entity174 . we have @entity174 who are part of the multinational force that observes the continuation of the monitoring ( of the ) @entity166 . we have @entity174 in the @entity4 . we 've had a few concerns about their safety . " @entity90 captured the @entity170 in the 1967 @entity198 and returned the land to @entity1 after the countries signed a peace treaty at @entity202 in 1979 . since @entity96 's ouster , " terrorists have worked continuously to manufacture tensions between @entity1 and @entity90 , attacking the gas pipeline to @entity90 and @entity206 15 times and launching a deadly cross-border raid on @entity90 last august that catalyzed a near - crisis in bilateral relations , " @entity101 and @entity102 said . @entity101 and @entity102 said @entity86 " has sought to cover his bets " on the @entity4 issue . " on the one hand , he issued a strong declaration condemning the attack , vowed to catch and punish the culprits , and traveled to @entity0 with field marshal @entity219 to assess the situation himself . on the other hand , he also permitted his @entity88 colleagues to issue a venomous statement blaming @entity90 's intelligence agency , @entity140 , for the attack and warning @entity1 to beware of those trying to sabotage the revolution . " but they said a " responsible leader , one who wants international support to bolster his flagging economy , can not play childish games that pander to the worst instincts of @entity1 public opinion . indeed , any serious effort to prevent terrorist infiltration in @entity4 requires coordination with @entity90 , which -- even if kept in the shadows -- can not proceed in an environment of public vilification . " the paper said that , in light of the sunday attack , @entity1 should make improvements in its @entity4 presence and realize that the @entity174 sees @entity4 " as an essential aspect of @entity1 - @entity90 peace . " a failure to improve security on the peninsula could trigger an overall reassessment of the @entity174 military assistance package , with an eye to updating this 1980s - era relationship for the current environment . " last year , under an annex to the treaty with @entity90 , @entity1 was permitted to move an additional seven battalions into the @entity4 . yet these forces are reportedly underequipped and have avoided patrolling terrorist hotspots , " the paper said , referring to the violence in @entity0 and @entity125 . " moreover , according to reports , @entity1 's security presence along the border with @entity90 is dangerously deficient -- so much so that @entity90 patrols are occasionally obliged to provide food and other essentials to their @entity1 counterparts . " @entity2 's @entity269 contributed to this report .

the violence comes just days after another attack in @placeholder that killed 16 @entity1 soldiers
