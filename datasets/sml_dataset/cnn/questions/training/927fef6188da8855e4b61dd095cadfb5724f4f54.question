@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- quick : name the governor of @entity1 . nope , not @entity5 . he 's no reality tv star . is n't on anyone 's list of 2016 presidential candidates . and the local press thinks he 's so bland they call him the " oatmeal governor . " but @entity1 gov. @entity14 deserves national name - recognition for one reason : he 's taking on one of the most important issues of our time . he 's trying to get @entity1 to talk about the " resident evil " of rape . " it 's culturally permissible to be silent about it , " and that must change , @entity14 told me in a recent interview at the governor 's office in @entity0 . ( you commissioned that trip , by the way , as part of @entity2 's @entity35 project . more on that here . ) for years , this state -- which has the highest reported rate of rape in the country , according to 2012 @entity42 crime estimates -- denied it had a problem . politicos and advocates said maybe @entity1 reported rape more often than people in other states -- but , gosh , it could n't be a bigger problem here than elsewhere , could it ? related : the rapist next door @entity14 has helped end that era of senseless denial . in our interview , he called violence against women an " epidemic . " like an alcoholic must admit he has a problem in order to face it , he told me , the governor of the state with the highest rape rate must , too , fess up to the problem in order to solve it . " i ca n't wave a wand and solve alcoholism , i ca n't wave a wand and solve domestic violence , but i can work to create a climate where it 's culturally permissible to speak about these things with our family and friends , get people to help who cross our paths , to stand up for those who are being abused and hurt , " he said . " to me that 's a win in the end . " true enough . the cornerstone of @entity14 's campaign is his " @entity88 " initiative , which he announced in late 2009 after assuming the office from @entity5 . now nearing the end of his first full term and seeking re-election in 2014 , @entity14 , a @entity89 , oversees a state that has increased spending on sexual violence treatment and prevention at a time when the overall state budget is shrinking . the " @entity88 " program would receive $ 12.4 million in fiscal year 2015 if the governor 's proposed budget were approved . that 's only 0.1 % of the total proposed budget , but it 's still considerable . the laid - back 51 - year - old governor , who looks like a kinder version of @entity107 plus @entity108 , was born in @entity109 but moved to @entity110 at age 10 , according to a biography on the @entity114 website . his dad was in the @entity116 and later served in the state legislature . @entity14 , an attorney , once worked as a lobbyist for @entity119 and other oil and gas interests . he served in the state legislature and then as lieutenant governor to @entity5 . even liberals in the state , like @entity125 , who started the first women 's shelter in @entity0 , praise the fact that he has supported addressing domestic violence and rape since the 1990s as a member of the legislature . @entity14 was elected to the @entity132 at age 29 . i disagree with some of @entity14 's policies -- he 's not giving enough autonomy to native alaskan communities and courts , for instance , which may be well poised in some cases to handle cases of sexual and gender - based violence ; his decision to block part of @entity148 is unwise ; and , despite substantial efforts to change things , parts of the state is so remote they 're almost totally lawless , which leads people to rape and abuse with a sense of near - impunity . the lawless ' end of the land ' but the governor 's efforts to get @entity1 to talk about rape and violence against women are laudable in and of themselves . no policy will be able to fix this problem as long as silence and shame surround rape and abuse . someone 's got to speak up . i saw some results of the " @entity174 " program firsthand : â € ¢ in @entity0 , i met members of the @entity177 basketball team , which participates in a program called @entity179 . the team 's coach , @entity180 , talks with his players regularly about healthy dating relationships and respect for women . a star shooting guard , @entity186 , 18 , told me there have been instances when he 's told teammates not to use demeaning language about women because of what he learned as part of the program . â € ¢ in one small town in southwest @entity1 , i met young people who are learning about the @entity198 culture in after - school programs at the @entity200 , which receives funding from the state . the idea is that traditional culture can strengthen society and , ultimately , reduce rates of sexual assault . i also met women who were flown into a shelter run by the coalition from outlying villages that are not connected to road systems . â € ¢ across @entity1 , i saw the power of a statewide survey analyzed by the @entity215 , and funded by the state . the survey effectively ended debate about whether @entity1 has a problem with domestic violence and sexual assault , said @entity222 , director of the center . the 2010 survey of 871 adult women found 37 % had suffered sexual violence and 59 % had been the victim of sexual violence and / or intimate partner violence in their lifetimes . " it was shocking and distressing for many people " to see how common violence against women really was in @entity1 , said @entity236 , executive director of the @entity237 on @entity238 and @entity239 , a state - funded agency . that survey also has spurred change . 5 ways to help end rape in @entity1 @entity1 should n't have needed those shocking numbers in order to act , but they do underscore the need for urgent action , and that information has won converts . @entity14 told me he is convinced @entity1 can change in part because his own grandfather was verbally and physically abusive to his family . but violence stopped with @entity14 's father , who was never violent , he said . " that gives me hope for the future of our country , when i see people taking that responsibility to live larger than what they 've been taught , " the governor said . @entity14 is leaning on his people to spread the message that violence against women haunts @entity1 and should not be tolerated . the state promotes a series of " @entity88 " marches , which were organized in more than 140 communities across the state last year and will be held again in the spring . those rallies help create a climate where " more people come to safety and more people are willing to speak about the unspeakable , " @entity14 said . " that 's been the hardest part about the evil among us : we have n't been willing to talk about it , " the governor added . " the ' @entity174 ' initiative has given @entity1 permission to speak about these things . " meet @entity1 's pioneer woman he added : " i 'm also sending a message as a man to women who have endured this shame that they are not to blame . they do not need to carry the guilt and shame -- and we are willing to embrace and love them unconditionally . " @entity14 would like the " @entity174 " campaign to spread across the country . he told me sports figures , in particular , have the power to raise awareness about ending sexual violence . " this is going to be won in the hearts and minds of our young people , " he said . " to have a nation where every person lives free of fear ... and every person has that hope and opportunity for the future , that 's my dream . but it 's going to take everybody -- it 's going to take ' real - deal ' heroes standing up and speaking out and giving people permission to speak about this . " those " real - deal heroes " should include people like @entity5 , the woman still more associated with the governorship in the @entity329 public 's mind than @entity14 . and -- forget celebrity -- they should include you , too . hold a " @entity174 " march in your community and let me know about it by tagging your photos # chooserespect on @entity338 , @entity339 or @entity340 . if you tag your photos , they will show up on this page . @entity344 points if you can convince @entity5 to upload one , too . states where rape is most common the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity350 .
