@entity7 , @entity1 ( @entity3 -- relations between @entity5 nations and the @entity6 hinge on @entity6 leaders living up to their rhetoric about commitment to lasting peace in the @entity12 , @entity1 prince @entity0 told @entity3 saturday . @entity1 @entity0 talks with @entity3 's @entity13 about @entity6 relations with @entity5 nations . " president @entity19 , in his statement yesterday , said that he 's genuinely making the effort to accomplish a peaceful resolution , " @entity0 , who served as @entity1 ambassador to the @entity6 from 2005 to 2007 , told @entity3 's @entity13 in an interview friday . " we 've heard this before , " @entity0 said . " we need to see implementation . we need to see facts on the ground change . we need to see rhetoric change . we need to see presence on the ground . " he said he was encouraged by @entity19 's appointment of @entity32 as @entity12 envoy , saying , " @entity32 comes with a track record of success . " but he suggested @entity32 spend some time in the region to make real progress . " @entity6 envoys , when they 've dealt with the @entity12 , have always come and gone , " he said . " i think it would be wise for sen. @entity32 ... to pitch his tent in @entity42 or in @entity43 , let 's say , and spend a year , two , perhaps three years on the ground dealing with the daily aspects of making peace there . " watch as @entity0 talks about how the @entity6 and the @entity12 could build trust Â» the @entity6 ' backing of @entity51 , in light of the latest @entity51 military operations in @entity54 , does not improve its standing in the @entity5 world , he said . " what happened in @entity54 , people have called it a tragedy , " @entity0 said . " i 'd go further and say it was a catastrophe in all aspects of that word . the killing and the destruction was so barbaric by @entity51 , and unprecedented in a such a small area like @entity54 . they [ @entity51 ] claim that they were very careful about collateral damage and they targeted only @entity69 , as they call them , militants and operatives . well , look at the figures . " more than 400 children killed out of 1,300 [ total deaths ] . that does n't show any precision of targeting . @entity51 claims that these are mishaps of war . if they are mishaps of war , well , why should you have a war ? " i think this is one of the issues that makes the relationship between the @entity5 world in general and @entity1 in particular threatened when it comes to dealing with the @entity6 , " @entity0 said . " ... and president @entity89 , i think callously and unforgivably , gave @entity51 a green light to do everything that they wanted to do in @entity54 without restraint . " @entity6 and @entity51 officials should recognize that operations like the recent one only serve to strengthen @entity69 , as " @entity51 is a radioactive element in the area . anyone it touches becomes heroic and legitimate ... because he or she is a victim . " @entity102 said he believes the @entity6 and @entity51 should negotiate with @entity69 . reminded that the two nations consider @entity69 a terrorist organization , he said , " i think this is another of the things that has to be reviewed by president @entity19 . " he believes that negotiations with @entity69 should not undermine the @entity108 , saying the authority 's president @entity115 " in my view , is the most tailor - made @entity108 leader for making peace and bringing stability and security to the @entity108 people . " @entity51 's operation in @entity54 came after what it said was a barrage of rockets fired by @entity69 militants into southern @entity51 . asked how to stop the rockets , @entity0 said he thinks the key is to bring @entity69 into the political fold . " put it the other way , " he said . " how can we convince @entity51 itself not to provoke @entity69 into firing rockets ? " @entity51 claims that @entity69 fired first , and @entity0 said these claims underscore the importance of having someone on the ground like @entity32 . " to see who is telling the truth in a case like that is needed , and a necessity today , more than at any other time , " he said . the @entity6 has called for nations like @entity1 to accept @entity51 and normalize relations with the nation , he said , but @entity51 must make the first move . " @entity51 has to normalize relations with @entity144 before @entity1 will normalize relations with @entity51 . everybody asks us to recognize @entity51 and to normalize ... nobody asks @entity51 to recognize @entity144 and normalize relations with @entity144 . i think that 's unfair . " @entity5 nations stand ready to make peace with @entity51 , he said , but @entity51 has not demonstrated an equal willingness . " that 's the pity of it . " he said @entity19 should ask @entity51 to accept the @entity5 peace plan . " and when the @entity51 accept the @entity5 peace plan , the @entity5 world has already set up a mechanism to deal with that issue . they 've chosen @entity162 and @entity163 to sit down with the @entity51 and deal with the @entity5 peace initiative . " @entity51 government spokesman @entity165 told @entity3 the nation does not publicly discuss contacts with @entity5 nations with which it has no official diplomatic relations . @entity51 welcomed the @entity1 peace initiative , he said , and is willing to negotiate with all @entity5 countries , including the @entity172 . asked about his confidence in @entity19 , @entity0 said , " i 'll have confidence when i see things done on the ground , and president @entity19 can do something and gain the confidence and support of the @entity5 and @entity180 nations by showing that he has done things on the ground and not simply expressed a wish for that . " if not , he said the @entity5 world 's relationship with the @entity6 is at stake . " popular sentiment , already @entity6 is at its lowest level in the history of its engagement with the @entity5 and @entity180 world , " he said . " in terms of government relations , that is something that will have to be decided by the leaderships in the @entity5 world and @entity6 , but it 's not a pretty picture . "
