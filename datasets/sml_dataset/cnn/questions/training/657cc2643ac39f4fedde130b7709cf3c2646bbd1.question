" @entity64 described a @entity66 - style evacuation as he , his fiancee and four dogs and three cats greeted the @entity43 truck . " we had to go ( through ) knee - deep water , at least . we had to wade our animals across into the truck to get them there , " said @entity64 . " that was the first thing you can grab , your loved ones -- and that 's what we have . " the @entity43 also was evacuating the entire population -- 285 people -- from the town of @entity83 by helicopter , @entity40 affiliate @entity79 reported . four helicopters were being used for rescues in @entity13 friday , @entity10 said . the sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads .
