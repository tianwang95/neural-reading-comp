this weekend , @entity0 successfully landed on @entity1 . now the one - ton roving robotic laboratory , part of @entity6 's four - ton @entity5 spacecraft , gets down to business . its task ? determining whether @entity1 ever did or could support life . that 's the big question . to quote @entity12 's @entity11 in " @entity13 " : " of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world , " why should life occur only on planet earth ? living organisms are found in the most improbable places -- in the dark , sulfurous depths of the oceans and in the driest deserts . news : curiosity rover lands on @entity1 all it takes is some water , carbon , a few other elements and energy . in fact , the organic chemicals needed for life seem to occur naturally everywhere , even in chilly , dry interstellar space . on @entity36 , the first living cells followed , then multi-cell organisms , and eventually humans . so , are we alone , or not ? it seems likely that life has arisen on other planets , in our solar system or near other stars or in other galaxies . it 's natural to wonder what 's out there . probably , @entity48 sat around their campfires speculating whether others roamed the land . exploring our solar system and looking for signs of life is the lifeblood of @entity6 . more than a century ago , @entity56 wrote about " little green men " on @entity1 and astronomers reported seeing irrigation canals through telescopes . nowadays , we know better -- @entity1 certainly does not harbor walking , talking aliens , nor does any other planet or moon in our solar system , notwithstanding fictional depictions like the famous @entity67 movie " @entity68 . " but @entity1 might harbor simpler forms of life , or might have done so in the past . and it 's an entirely new environment . most of what we know about " habitability " -- the ability of an environment to host and support life -- has been studied under the very different conditions on @entity36 . for example , scientists investigate the hyper - dry environments found in @entity84 ( but there is still a lot of water , compared with @entity1 ) or @entity88 ( dry enough , but much hotter than @entity1 ) . curiosity will explore the completely different conditions on @entity1 . on sunday , the @entity5 executed a series of maneuvers designed to slow its approach to the @entity1 surface . at the start , it was moving at 13,200 miles per hour , and needed to be slowed down , to keep it from ending up a smashed pile of rubble . to do this the laboratory used the thin atmosphere , which slowed it down , albeit not as effectively as the @entity36 's more substantial atmosphere slows re-entering spacecraft . then it released a parachute and fired some rockets to decelerate more before gently lowering the @entity0 on cables until it reached the surface . scientists monitoring the landing at the @entity115 , including the president 's @entity116 , @entity118 , were elated . the crowd watching the @entity6 feed in @entity121 cheered and began chanting , " @entity116 ! science ! " the curiosity rover is roughly the size of a @entity125 . it cost a lot more and has better fuel economy , having coasted 352 million miles since launch , in 8.5 months . scientists back on @entity36 used the long voyage to calibrate instruments and practice operating them . the mission has three goals : to assess the habitability of @entity1 , past and present ; to study its geology and geochemistry ; and to investigate planetary processes relevant to habitability , including the role of water . it is also useful preparation for future missions to @entity1 , perhaps including astronauts . curiosity is not unlike a human : it has " eyes " ( cameras ) with which to see and analyze the landscape . there are eight " hazcams " front and back , to take stereo black - and - white pictures for depth perception , and four navigation cameras ( " navcams " ) at the top of an extendable mast . besides the high mast , it has an " arm " that can go even higher and carries another camera . it has " feet " -- wheels , actually -- capable of rolling over obstacles up to 2½ feet high . curiosity has " ears " to hear commands relayed from @entity6 's @entity172 via the @entity173 and @entity175 spacecraft orbiting @entity1 . curiosity has many " mouths " to taste test rocks or dust it vacuums up -- really , to analyze them chemically . in fact , just like science labs on @entity36 , it has a number of complex instruments capable of testing the properties of solids , liquids and gases . since cosmic radiation alters surface composition , @entity0 can drill into rock to extract pristine material from below . this is especially important for finding organic molecules that might be destroyed on the surface . curiosity may be a robot , but it acts like a scientist : always skeptical , running experimental controls , double and triple checking every result . unlike humans , thankfully , the robot wo n't be ( easily ) killed by radiation or toxic substances . how do we know what signs of life to look for ? one example : by studying rocks on @entity36 , geologists know how different kinds of rocks formed and changed over time . in particular , biological materials alter igneous rocks in well - understood ways . were we to see the same kinds of weathered rock on @entity1 , it 's a good guess that life was once present on the @entity1 surface . other instruments will test for atomic elements , organic materials , radiation and water . over the next @entity1 year ( 687 @entity36 days ) , @entity0 will try to satisfy our curiosity about the world around us . space is today 's frontier . renowned historian @entity229 posited that the @entity231 character was shaped by the frontier experience . with @entity6 's @entity5 , we 're all @entity233 and @entity234 . let the exploration and learning begin . follow @ @entity237 on twitter

@entity240 : rocks on @placeholder can give up clues about whether any life has existed there
