( @entity0 ) -- tuesday night 's @entity1 was chock full of buxom beauties , bedazzled bras and @entity4 . the sexiest night on television opened with a bang and kept its momentum alive throughout the show thanks to the musical stylings of @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 . photos : 2012 @entity1 here are the top 10 moments of the night : 1 . @entity14 ringmaster @entity15 opened the show in style . after the shock wore off that it was humanly possible to be that fit two months after giving birth , i became more aware of the show 's aesthetics . a bizarre song mix and circus motif , marked by the @entity28 ' mime and clown costumes and professional aerial contortionists , made the first runway walk truly memorable . as @entity31 ' " @entity40 ) " blended into @entity32 's " @entity39 , " i had a clear vision of what the rest of the night would hold : rock & roll and sex . 2 . diamonds and @entity42 even with a bevy of semi-naked ladies strutting beside her , @entity9 managed to steal the show with her first performance of the night . wearing a black , strapless , corseted dress , the songstress was dressed more demurely than usual but sill looked smokin ' hot thanks to her gown 's high slit and garters . @entity0 : @entity9 , @entity11 and more perform at @entity1 3 . @entity56 in the most dramatic moment of the night , an @entity57 lost her ... hat . the behind - the - scenes cameras followed model @entity63 backstage as a team of stylists struggled to pin her top hat to her head . dressed as " @entity69 " to open the calendar girls segment of the show , a reluctant @entity63 was forced to take the plunge with an incomplete look . how could the audience possibly have known that she represented january without that pink hat ? 4 . @entity76 @entity10 may have been singing " @entity78 , " but he was surrounded by @entity28 on stage . accompanied by a live band , @entity10 fit the part of an old - school musician in the 1950s - themed calendar girls segment . he probably landed on @entity84 's naughty list by flirting with the scantily clad @entity86 , but we love him just the way he is . 5 . @entity89 before the barely - legal @entity11 hit the stage , he salivated over the girls coming off the runway backstage while the @entity28 sang his praises to the camera . if that was n't disturbing enough , the models also swooned in the background during his performances . @entity0 : @entity1 pink carpet pics 6 . making a @entity102 of you the pop sensation 's acoustic rendition of " @entity106 " was the only performance of the night not accompanied by a runway show . i was surprised by the age appropriateness of the act until the @entity112 commenced and the teen broke into " @entity114 . " @entity115 was n't there to show off her assets so @entity11 resorted to exchanging smoldering glances with the models instead . 7 . @entity120 aside from @entity11 's futuristic " 3012â € ³ space look , a few other odd outfits caught my eye during the @entity112 . there was @entity128 from " @entity129 , " who was business in the front , party in the back ; a sexy @entity134 from " @entity135 " ; and an angel in a bicycle handlebar - ed vest , prompting the question , " can you ride your bike with no handlebars ? " 8 . @entity140 @entity10 returned to the stage for a performance of " @entity143 " in my favorite segment of the night . the wings -- along with feather plumes , headdresses and sequins -- finally came out as the girls strutted their stuff in the show 's most extravagant costumes . whether evoking old @entity155 glamour or @entity157 decadence , the girls dazzled in diamonds and slow - motion sequences . yes , the @entity28 are young and wild , but @entity9 's " diamonds " would have been a more appropriate song choice . @entity0 : 11 years of fantasy bras from ' @entity1 ' 9 . model behavior the show featured a short segment spotlighting @entity167 model and @entity170 @entity169 cover girl @entity168 . aside from allowing her to be both seen and heard ( it 's safe to say that she did n't attend the @entity175 ) , the video was further proof that @entity1 should change its name to @entity178 . 10 . @entity28 in @entity179 after changing into a sheer , lingerie - style getup , @entity9 closed the show with her new single " @entity183 . " she faded more into the background this time around due to the trapeze acts and life - size flowers barging down the runway . of course , @entity188 looked flawless in her $ 2.5 million floral fantasy bra ( now that 's a push - up ! ) . i initially thought the bra was too over-the - top , even by @entity1 standards , but it fit the floral theme and looked relatively ordinary compared to her stunning , over-sized orchid wings . although a lesser known flower ( and model ) , @entity199 won the prize for the most adorable costume of the segment with a tiger lily skit with lily pad wings . @entity206 must have been stirring in his grave . see the full story at @entity0 . click here to try 2 risk free issues of @entity0 © 2011 @entity0 and @entity212 all rights reserved .
