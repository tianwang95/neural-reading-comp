much as exit polls in the @entity2 show after the election this week , the economy is a top concern for @entity6 leaders as the ruling @entity7 ( @entity7 ) gathers thursday for the @entity8 . the party is expected to select @entity10 and @entity11 to become the president and premier , respectively , of @entity6 for the next decade . the new leaders will take over an economy at a crossroads . on one hand , many analysts predict that when they hand over the reins to the next leaders in 2023 , @entity6 will be nearing the @entity2 as the world 's number one economy . on the other hand , the pair will be the first leaders in three decades since @entity6 opened to economic reform that have n't presided over double - digit growth . @entity10 : from ' sent - down youth ' to @entity6 's top " we 're going to have to see a new normal , " said @entity31 , director of the @entity32 , at a recent conference . " the hyper - fast growth rate over the last 10 years is unlikely to be replicated in the future . " the challenge is moving @entity6 from an export and investment led economy to one based on domestic consumer - based growth . the flood of investment and exports in the past decade helped the nation 's economy grow an astounding five times -- from $ 1.5 trillion in 2002 to an estimated $ 8.3 trillion this year -- and leap - frogging from the world 's sixth largest economy to its second . the stability of modern @entity7 rule has been built on the promise that it will create a better future for @entity6 's 1.3 billion citizens , one that has largely been delivered by leaders since @entity59 opened the country to economic reform in 1979 . in that time , more than 600 million people have been lifted out of abject poverty . a government think tank predicted this week that in seven years 600 million @entity6 will be part of its swelling middle class . more than half of the country 's workers now reside in urban areas , as rural migrants move to cities for better employment opportunities . @entity6 's next leaders : who 's who now the economy has entered an adolescent phase , analysts say , with a burgeoning middle class that 's spending more domestically -- making @entity6 the world 's number market in everything from beer sales to car purchases . yet the economy is still strongly tied to exports , as seen by its slowdown in the wake of the @entity91 debt crisis and anemic growth in the @entity2 @entity93 set a target of 7.5 % this year , the first time the government has forecast growth below 8 % in the past decade . " the average migrant worker 's wages increased 15 % this year , and inflation is only 1.9 % , so that means lower - wage workers can spend , " said @entity98 , managing director of @entity99 in @entity100 . " it 's the middle class consumer that is getting squeezed , especially at multinational corporations , because their wages are being squeezed . " the expectations of @entity6 's emerging consumer class are also changing . " when i came to @entity6 20 years ago , the average age of a @entity6 worker was 24 -- now the average age is 37 , " said @entity111 , the founding partner of @entity112 in @entity93 , which advises firms on foreign direct investments . shadow of @entity119 still lingers over @entity6 " when a worker is 24 , he 's interested in earning a bit of wages , chasing girls , buying cigarettes and beer , " @entity111 said . " now that guys is 37 , married , has a kid , car , mortgage , wants to send kid to a good school , and travel abroad with the family on trips . " but as @entity6 's fortune 's rise , more of that wealth is going into fewer hands . a study earlier this year by @entity140 in @entity6 four that @entity6 's top 10 % of households surveyed have 57 % of the country 's total income and 85 % of total assets . " inequality is no longer just a social issue , " @entity31 said . " very importantly , for the migrant ( workers ) -- there are about 200 million of them in the cities -- and their income has gone up fast but below those who are older city residents . what do you do with this ? they require reform . " addressing income disparity is a thornier proposition than simply building the new roads , airports and other infrastructure projects that have helped propel the @entity6 economy . ' one party , two coalitions ' -- @entity6 's factional politics " an effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads , railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment , " said professor @entity168 , director of the @entity169 . " if the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens , @entity6 workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies , unemployment and retirement , and more likely to buy goods and services . " the pressure on health and pension services will soon skyrocket . @entity6 's one child policy started in the 1980s curbed population growth , but @entity93 now faces a rising tide of retiring workers . by 2030 the number of people over the age of 60 will " increase from about 185 million to over 350 million and that 's going to be larger than the size of the @entity2 ( population ) , " @entity31 noted . in his speech at the opening of the @entity205 , outgoing leader @entity202 made an ambitious target for 2020 to double per capita income in @entity6 from 2010 levels for both rural and urban dwellers -- the first time a resident 's per capita income has been included in economic targets , state - run media @entity214 notes . @entity6 's @entity8 : why so secretive ? " the development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions is still large , and so are income disparities , " @entity202 said . " unbalanced , uncoordinated and unsustainable development remains a big problem . " it 's a clear sign @entity93 is worried about income disparity , and the setting of hard targets could put fire to reforms . @entity228 will tell if @entity6 's new leadership will be able to deliver .
