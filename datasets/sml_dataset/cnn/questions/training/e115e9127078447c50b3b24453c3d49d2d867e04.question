( @entity0 ) -- a nervous calm settled over northwest @entity2 on monday night , three days after clashes between indigenous citizens and national police left more than 30 dead and 50 wounded . @entity6 , a leader of the protesters , says his followers did not kill police officers . a 3 p.m. -6 a.m. curfew seemed to be holding , and both sides in the bloody episode said they wanted dialogue , not bullets . " the situation is much more tranquil , " foreign minister @entity15 told @entity0 . " there 's the possibility of entering into a dialogue . " the violence started friday when national police attacked a roadblock near the city of @entity24 in the @entity26 part of northwestern @entity2 . about 2,500 indigenous people had blocked the main road to protest measures the government has taken to sell land to energy companies and other businesses . @entity34 native to the area say that it is their land even though they do n't have formal property titles . when it was over , many lay dead and wounded . how many -- and what happened -- depends on who 's telling the story . @entity15 said 24 police were killed and nine @entity26 natives lost their lives . he said he did not know the number of wounded . @entity49 , however , said more than 30 demonstrators and 22 police have been killed since friday . the web sites for @entity54 radio and @entity56 newspaper said at least 33 people died , including 22 police . more than 50 people have been injured , various reports said . @entity34 rights advocates put the number of dead and missing as much higher , with some groups saying more than 100 were killed or are missing . the @entity63 advocacy group accused the government of ditching bodies in rivers and the jungle to suppress the death count . " there seems to be a concerted government effort to cover up the number of indigenous deaths , " said @entity69 , @entity2 program coordinator for @entity63 . @entity15 emphatically denied the accusation . " that is a lie , " he said . " part of the great lies that have been told about @entity24 -- that a massacre occurred , but more police than indigenous were killed . if this is true , let the family members come forth and tell us this happened . " @entity63 and indigenous supporters say the police -- some in helicopters -- opened fire indiscriminately and without provocation on the roadblock about 450 miles ( 730 kilometers ) north of @entity92 , the capital . " police began in the morning by firing tear gas , " @entity69 told @entity0 . " when people did not move and were standing strong , they began firing shots . " @entity15 said the helicopters fired tear gas and police were fired upon , too . " the police did not want to use their arms , " he said , noting that many of the dead officers were killed with weapons protesters had taken from authorities . ten police were killed after they were taken hostage when they arrived to help other officers and were surrounded by protesters , @entity15 said . more than 70 suspects have been arrested , @entity15 said . @entity69 placed the count at 150 and said 900 others are in hiding . " eight to 10 police officers had their throat slit , " @entity15 said . " somebody must be held accountable for that , do n't you think ? " @entity69 agreed that if " indigenous people tortured and killed police , they should be brought to justice . " authorities had been searching for @entity6 , leader of the indigenous rights group behind the @entity24 demonstrations , but he sought refuge in the @entity129 embassy in @entity92 , @entity2 prime minister @entity123 said monday night . officials said monday they will remove a roadblock within the next two days in the main highway between the cities of @entity134 and @entity135 . @entity134 officials met with indigenous leaders monday to negotiate dismantling the roadblock , the state - run @entity137 news agency said . the roadblocks have been hurting @entity2 's economy , since export shipments of oil and other resources have not been able to get through . @entity2 president @entity147 vowed to put down the demonstrations , some of which have been going on since early april . " we will not give in to violence or blackmail , " he said in a speech sunday . @entity147 blamed unnamed foreign governments for influencing the indigenous uprising . @entity15 pointed to @entity157 and @entity158 , which have held demonstrations in favor of indigenous rights . " they are badly informed , accusing the government of @entity2 of genocide , " he said . he called statements by high - level @entity157 and @entity158 officials " an act of intervention into @entity2 's internal affairs . " regardless of the cause , analysts agree this is the worst violence in @entity2 since the brutal @entity174 guerrilla insurgency died down in the 1990s . " that 's a lot of violence , " said @entity175 , president of the @entity178 - based @entity177 policy group . " there 's no question the government is in a very difficult period . " @entity185 , who was @entity187 president @entity186 's assistant secretary of state for inter-american affairs from 1989 to 1993 , sees a danger that the violence could escalate . " when there are that many people in a clash , that 's very bad regardless of the specifics , " he said . " that 's worrisome . ... it obviously raises fears and concerns that you could have some kind of rekindling of violence . " the crux of the issue concerns @entity2 's economy and how the indigenous population fit in a 21st - century world . " @entity147 has committed to rapid growth , rapid development , " @entity175 said . that means @entity147 has opened up vast parts of undeveloped land to companies that want to extract natural resources . the indigenous populations feel they are being displaced and are pushing back . " this is very different from what happened with the @entity174 because these are indigenous people . they are not political people , " @entity69 said . " all they are asking for is their rights . "
