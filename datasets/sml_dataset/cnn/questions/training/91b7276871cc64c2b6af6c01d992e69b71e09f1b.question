( @entity0 ) there may be plenty of idiots on the road , but is putting them in the skies taking it , quite literally , to the next dimension ? for dr. @entity12 -- one of the leading researchers on the ' @entity11 ' project -- it 's a serious question . making an idiot - proof flying car that anyone can pilot has involved years of painstaking research and may be the secret to the long - held dream of firing up the rotors , levitating and simply flying out of the bumper - to - bumper grind . now the @entity21 wants to make the dream a reality , researching the feasibility of small commuter air vehicles to ease the world 's traffic congestion . " it 's been a dream of mine since i read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid , but science fiction is becoming the reality these days , " says dr. @entity12 , director of perception , cognition and action at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 . under the four - year project , the @entity21 has drawn together six institutes from across @entity45 to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles ( @entity48 ) . at the center of the research is a focus , not so much on building the vehicle , but on all the issues and challenges surrounding commuter aviation . in the case of his institute , it 's how to make the machine accessible to ordinary drivers . a flying car for everybody " there 's no intention with this project to actually build the system , " explains @entity64 whose research is part of a 2007 @entity21 report called " @entity68 : @entity73 " . " they said to us ' please , not another proposal for a flying vehicle ' - we have received so many - there are so many other issues to address , " he said . these challenges involve setting up " virtual corridor " traffic systems in the sky that guide @entity48 under existing aircraft , using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers . " if you want to make a flying car it should be for everybody , but you ca n't make every car driver into a pilot , " he said . " the idea is to fly in uncontrolled airspace without interfering with all the other aircraft . " he said the plan is to make the flying vehicles so intelligent , they communicate with each other and avoid collisions without any human input . keeping it simple his institute , in particular , is focused on the problems of the human - machine interface : creating a design that reduces the withering array of dials and monitors in a helicopter or plane into a few simple controls on a dashboard . keeping the simple steering wheel on a flying vehicle -- where controls must make adjustments for traveling through three rather than two dimensions -- has been just one of the challenges of the project . " for more than 100 years cars have used the steering wheel . it was a good idea for cars , but if you make the transition to the air why should a driver learn something completely new ? " he said . pilotless planes the aircraft would be largely autonomous and would , for the most part , need no piloting at all . flying through " highways in the sky " - flight paths designed to host swarms of @entity48 flying in formation - the @entity48 would avoid obstacles and select landing spots autonomously by using intelligent sight sensors . the controls would be shared between the pilot and the machine allowing for what researchers call " comprehensive situational awareness . " so - called " haptic " controls that put a feeling of resistance in the steering wheel would allow drivers to know when they were edging towards the confines of the " highway in the sky " . other aspects of the study have looked at the social impact of @entity48 as the commuter vehicle of the future . " many people might ask whether we really want thousands of these things buzzing around in the sky , " dr @entity12 said . researchers have been looking at ways of constructing @entity48 flight paths above existing freeways and roads to minimize the environmental impact , keeping the flight ceiling at 50 meters to avoid commercial aircraft . while flying time is relatively short due to the constraints of battery life using current technology , researchers on the project had found that 90 percent of commuter trips were shorter than 25 km ( 15 miles ) and averaged about 30 minutes with peak hour delays of about 15 minutes , making a @entity48 perfect for short hop journeys from work to home . @entity190 holds open the door dr @entity12 said recent advances , and social acceptance of , @entity190 's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project . " that really makes me very optimistic , " he said . " the car industry has been producing the same basic model of automobile for more than 100 years . @entity190 is doing something that is making the car industry wake up . i would never have expected that several states in the @entity204 have legalized autonomous driving , for example . " " even so , there are many issues still to be examined . legally , for instance , if there 's no driver we do n't know who 's responsible in case of a crash . these questions still need to be answered . " while the driverless car is now a reality , he says it might be some time yet before anyone can walk into a dealership and buy a personal aviation vehicle . " the timescale is to have them available by 2050 , " says dr @entity12 . " but i am not likely to be around in 2050 , so i 'm quietly optimistic that we will have one before that . " read more from tomorrow transformed : can this one - wheeled wonder change the way you commute to work ? will people still be useful in the 21st century ? the " green man " in your traffic lights just got new super powers

called ' @placeholder ' , it aims to consider all the issues surrounding personal aviation vehicles
