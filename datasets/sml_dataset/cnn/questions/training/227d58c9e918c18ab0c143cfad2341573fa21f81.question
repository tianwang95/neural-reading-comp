( @entity0 ) -- on saturday , the " let 's make ourselves feel better " club will convene in @entity4 to try to figure out what to do about @entity6 . the motives of those gathering in @entity4 at the invitation of @entity11 special envoy @entity10 -- the five permanent members of the @entity13 ( @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 ) , plus @entity19 and a number of @entity22 league members including @entity23 and @entity24 -- are well - intentioned . their concern over the continued killing , more than 12,000 dead with thousands more wounded and imprisoned , is understandable . but sadly , the results of the @entity4 meeting , even with some added wind at its back ( the @entity19 are madder than ever at @entity6 for downing a @entity19 reconnaissance plane earlier this week ) , are not likely to produce much new . the purpose of the meeting is to gain agreement on a new @entity10 plan for a national unity government and a political transition to stop the conflict . but this is unlikely to work any more effectively than @entity10 's earlier six point cease - fire approach . chances are the conflict in @entity6 is going to get worse before it gets worse . the core problem is that the options on @entity6 are all bad , and nobody wants to assume responsibility for a conflict that pits a regime that still has tremendous firepower against an opposition that is growing stronger but still is n't in a position to bring that regime down . there has been too much blood for diplomatic compromise , and military solutions are risky and too uncertain . the other challenge is that the international community is fundamentally divided . instead of a coalition of the willing and the determined , the group that will gather saturday resembles a group of the unwilling , the uncooperative and the disabled . their motives and agendas diverge even while on the surface they all know that @entity6 president @entity66 must go and that the current situation could harm all their interests . still , the risks of changing the status quo through using force against the regime is still greater than maintaining it . at the meeting , all will express that concern and try to come up with new ways to support and organize the @entity6 opposition and pressure the regime . there may even be a notional agreement on the new @entity10 plan . but here 's what the three main players -- the @entity14 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- are really thinking . @entity14 : the @entity14 is appalled by the violence and would like to do more . but president @entity87 is really much more focused on domestic issues ; he knows there is no will or stomach for new foreign commitments or for risky military adventures in the wake of @entity95 and @entity23 . the @entity14 fears an open - ended military commitment and wo n't act alone . nor does it want to see an outcome that leaves elements of the old regime in place . at the same time it has been wary of half - measures : safe zones and arming the @entity6 opposition . @entity106 is too conflicted to lead . the @entity18 : the fact is @entity18 's @entity108 knows @entity66 is done , but he is n't going to let the @entity14 dictate the outcome as they did in @entity110 . the @entity18 have seen all their clients -- @entity112 , @entity113 and now @entity66 under pressure -- one way or another removed by the @entity14 . as a great power , @entity18 is determined to preserve its influence in @entity6 ; it sells arms and uses the @entity6 port of @entity120 as a key naval facility ( @entity18 's only base outside the @entity123 ) . @entity108 also does n't want to see a @entity126 - backed @entity125 regime in @entity127 . he resents the @entity126 for supporting muslims in @entity129 and in the @entity130 . so he 'll push for a solution that preserves some of the old regime and the @entity134 minority , and of course a major @entity18 role in the outcome @entity18 is too suspicious to help broker . @entity19 : the @entity19 are angry and embarrassed at the @entity6 downing of one of their planes , which made them look weak . but if @entity145 really wanted to play a leadership role , it could have used this incident as an excuse to push for military action . there 's no real stomach among the @entity19 public for a war with @entity6 , however . @entity19 also is worried about @entity6 support for the @entity156 @entity155 and its own @entity158 minority . the fact is unless the refugee flows from @entity6 to @entity19 get a whole lot worse or the killing reaches new levels , @entity19 will be very careful about taking too high a profile on @entity6 . the @entity19 are too tentative to lead . and so it goes . the contact group in @entity4 may show new resolve , issue tough statements and make contingency plans . it could even endorse @entity10 's plan for a national unity government . but even if some new measure is announced , the meeting will be marked far more by what 's not said than by what is . the @entity6 situation is a tragedy , but it 's a tragedy nobody is yet prepared to take responsibility for . the costs of bringing down the @entity182 would be considerable , but the price of rebuilding the new @entity6 will be greater . the @entity4 group should start planning . sooner or later the @entity66 regime will break . and when it does , the international community must be willing to step in with thousands of peacekeepers on the ground and billions in cash to reconstruct and keep the country running . if it does n't , an even greater @entity6 tragedy will begin to unfold with a heightened level of violence , sectarian killing and perhaps even the fragmentation of the country . the international community may be too divided to bring down the @entity182 , but it must gear itself up to be united to avert an even greater catastrophe when they fall . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .
