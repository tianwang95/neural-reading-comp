@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- president @entity2 used a @entity4 ceremony to say it is time for @entity6 to properly welcome home @entity8 veterans and show them and their families the respect and gratitude they deserved but did n't receive decades ago . " you came home and sometimes were denigrated when you should have been celebrated , " @entity2 said beneath a scorching sun at the @entity13 . " it was a national shame , a disgrace that should have never happened . that 's why here today , we resolve that it will not happen again . " the event , which launched a 13 - year @entity8 50th anniversary commemoration , was the culmination of a day of somber events on the annual holiday honoring @entity6 's war dead . by the numbers : veterans and @entity4 earlier , @entity2 laid a wreath to fallen @entity6 warriors at @entity31 , then pledged the full support of a grateful nation to returning veterans and their families . " for the first time in nine years , @entity6 are not fighting and dying in @entity39 , " the president said to applause . " we are winding down the war in @entity42 and our troops will continue to come home . after a decade under the dark cloud of war , we can see the light of a new day on the horizon . " now the task is to remember those who died and " meet our obligations to those who did come home , " @entity2 said , adding , " @entity6 will be there for you . " at the @entity57 , retired @entity56 lt. gen. @entity55 paid tribute to the fallen from that conflict . " at this site , we remember the 400,000 men and women who lost their lives defending our freedom during @entity65 some 70 years ago , " he said . " @entity4 remains a time of solemn observance as we remember and honor all of those who gave all their tomorrows . that 's a very high price to pay when you 're 18 and 19 years old . but they gave all their futures so that you and i could live in this strong , free and beautiful @entity6 . @entity75 is not free . " this year marks the 50th anniversary of the @entity6 deploying a significant military presence in @entity8 . in 1962 , about 10,000 @entity6 military advisers joined the 900 already in the country . a proclamation signed friday by @entity2 said the @entity8 50th anniversary commemoration will continue until november 11 , 2025 , " to honor and give thanks to a generation of proud @entity6 who saw our country through one of the most challenging missions we have ever faced . " " while no words will ever be fully worthy of their service , nor any honor truly befitting their sacrifice , let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor , " the proclamation states . the first phase of the commemoration over the next two years involves generating support and participation , with a focus on " hometown " events providing personal recognition and thanks to @entity8 veterans , according to information provided to the media . ' the thing about remembering is that you do n't forget ' in his remarks at the ceremony , @entity2 spoke of making amends for the nation 's failure to properly welcome home @entity8 veterans in the 1960s and ' 70s . " a central part of this 50th anniversary is to tell your story as it should have been told all along , " the president said , calling it " another chance to set the record straight . " later , he called it " another opportunity to say to our @entity8 veterans what we should have been saying from the beginning : you did your job , you served with honor , you made us proud . " " you have earned your place among the greatest generations , " said @entity2 , who twice pulled out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat off his brow . in an emotional moment , he asked @entity8 veterans in the crowd to stand and spoke words he characterized as long overdue : " welcome home . welcome home . welcome home . thank you . we appreciate you . welcome home . " the lesson of @entity8 , @entity2 said , was to separate the war from the warrior , so that patriotism never again becomes what he called a " political sword " that divides the nation . " @entity157 can support a war , patriots can oppose a war and whatever our view , let us always stand united in support of our troops who we 've placed in harm 's way , " he said . decades later , @entity2 said , the true legacy from the " hard lessons " of @entity8 is that @entity6 is stronger and takes care of its returning veterans and their families . @entity2 and other speakers at the ceremony hosted by actor @entity173 , spoke of issues close to @entity8 veterans , including the continued effort to identify and repatriate remains of the more than 1,000 missing in action . facing a tough re-election campaign this year , @entity2 avoided direct political references but made sure to emphasize his administration 's efforts to help returning war veterans . military spending will be a major political battleground in coming months , with both @entity185 and @entity186 agreeing on the need to reduce budget deficits but in sharp disagreement over how to do it . if they ca n't reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year , sharp spending cuts are scheduled to take effect that would include military funding . in @entity197 , the certain @entity186 presidential nominee , @entity196 , held a @entity4 event to call for prioritizing military spending . saying " the world is not safe , " @entity196 said the choice is between shrinking the military to pay for social needs or to " commit to preserve @entity6 as the strongest military in the world . " " we choose that course in @entity6 not so that we win wars but so we can prevent wars , because a strong @entity6 is the best deterrent to war there ever has been invented , " @entity196 said . @entity1 's @entity211 contributed to this report .
