@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- opposition leader @entity3 took the stand for the first time tuesday and told a @entity1 court that she did not violate her house arrest when she offered temporary shelter to an @entity10 man who swam to her lakeside home . people of @entity1 living in @entity13 protest for the release of @entity3 on may 24 , 2009 in @entity15 , @entity13 . " she was very confident , very firm , very clear , " said @entity16 , the @entity17 ambassador to @entity1 , who was among diplomats and journalists allowed to watch the proceedings . " in a strange way , she commanded the courtroom , " he said . @entity3 , who is being tried on subversion charges , said she did not learn immediately that @entity24 swam nearly two miles and snuck into her crumbling , colonial - era bungalow on may 3 . she was told about the visitor the next day by one of two housekeepers who are her sole companions in the heavily guarded residence , where she was under house arrest . @entity3 's two helpers are also on trial , as is @entity24 . " i did n't know , " she said . " i was upstairs . " under questioning by a judge for half an hour , @entity3 said she provided @entity24 food but allowed him only to " stay temporarily . " @entity24 left late may 5 , she said . " he walked to the lakeside . but i do n't know which way he went , because it was very dark , " @entity3 said . the @entity41 laureate also acknowledged that @entity24 , a 53 - year - old former military serviceman from @entity42 , @entity43 , had visited her once before last november . " did you report to the authority about his arrival ? " the judge asked . " no , " she replied . @entity3 had earlier told supporters that she did not tell authorities about the latest intrusion because she did n't want @entity24 or anyone else to get in trouble . but it is this silence that the @entity1 's military junta is trying her for . the government said @entity24 's presence violated the conditions of @entity3 's house arrest . the country 's regime rarely allows @entity3 any visitors , and foreigners are not allowed overnight stays in local households without government permission . @entity3 has been under house arrest for 13 of the past 19 years -- a confinement the military junta has regularly extended . watch the @entity71 secretary general explain what he is doing for @entity3 Â» her latest round of home detention -- after five years of confinement -- expires wednesday , according to her supporters at home and abroad . last week , the military began prosecuting @entity3 on allegations of subversion at a prison compound near @entity0 . her supporters say the move is meant to keep her confined even longer -- beyond the general elections that the junta has scheduled for next year . if convicted , @entity3 , 63 , could be sentenced to three to five years in prison . before the proceedings got under way at the @entity90 compound tuesday , the junta said @entity3 's house arrest did not expire for six more months . and though the government said it considered releasing her at the end of the term , it said it had no choice but to try her after she met with @entity24 . " as @entity3 is the daughter of gen. @entity3 , the leader of our country , we were deeply thinking whether to extend her detention or not , " police brigadier general @entity97 told reporters tuesday . " unfortunately , a @entity10 citizen entered her house for two days . she allowed and made conversation with him , gave him food . " these kind of actions broke the law , " he added . " this is why we have no way but to open a case . and we are very sad about this case . " gen. @entity3 played an instrumental role in bringing about the country 's independence from @entity17 colonial rule . he was assassinated in 1947 and is still revered in @entity1 . @entity3 's lawyers rejected the junta 's explanation , saying the @entity71 had already deemed the opposition leader 's continuing detention unlawful under @entity1 's state protection laws . " the @entity71 has said her house arrest expired a year ago , " said @entity125 , her @entity10 - based lawyer . " they are out of time , and they can not detain her any longer under their own law . " @entity97 told reporters that the pro-democracy advocate had actually been under house arrest for four - and - a - half years . the official said @entity3 's house arrest officially went into effect on november 28 , 2004 . that gives the government six more months to restrict her movement , he said . @entity125 countered the government 's account , citing the conclusion of the @entity144 . the law is unclear whether detention begins from the time a person is arrested or when a detention order is issued , the council said . " this would suggest an interpretation that you start counting from the day you begin to detain her , " @entity125 said . in @entity3 's case , she was put under house arrest in may 2003 . " you ca n't issue an order months later and use that as your starting point . that creates an unfair period of detention , " he said . after @entity3 's testimony tuesday , the court asked the diplomats and journalists to leave . it denied a defense request to consult with @entity3 privately . the court then questioned @entity24 . he is charged with violating immigration laws and trespassing . the charges carry a maximum sentence of five years in prison . a lawyer selected by the @entity10 embassy is representing him . according to @entity24 's testimony in court friday , he made the unauthorized trip because he had a vision that @entity3 would be assassinated and he wanted to warn her . he muttered to himself during the proceedings , including utterances that @entity3 is innocent , said @entity182 , spokesman for @entity3 's @entity183 . @entity3 's prosecution has prompted international criticism , with nine @entity187 laureates -- including archbishop @entity188 of @entity189 -- calling it a " mockery . " @entity10 secretary of state @entity192 called the charges against @entity3 " baseless " and accused the junta of " continuing resistance to a free and open electoral process . " the @entity187 laureate has been the face of @entity1 's pro-democracy movement and the focus of a global campaign to free her . her party won over 80 percent of the legislative seats in 1990 . but she was disqualified from serving because of her house arrest , and the military junta ignored the results . the government has said next year 's scheduled elections will reintroduce democracy in @entity1 . but its plan includes a clause that forbids citizens who bore children with foreigners from running for office . that makes @entity3 ineligible . she married a @entity17 man and has two sons with him . @entity2 's @entity219 in @entity220 , @entity221 , and @entity222 contributed to this report .

@entity3 told @placeholder court that she is not guilty , has not broken any law
