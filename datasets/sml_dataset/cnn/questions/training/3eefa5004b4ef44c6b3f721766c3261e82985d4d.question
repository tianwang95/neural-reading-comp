( @entity0 ) -- it 's home to a sound system from @entity3 and an elephant slide from @entity5 . it 's where you 'll find an outdoor @entity10 boxing ring , exercise gear from @entity13 beach , lampposts from the @entity15 and swing benches from @entity17 . this is @entity19 , an urban park and cycling gateway that sprawls through @entity22 , a bohemian neighborhood of @entity23 that 's become one of the most ethnically diverse parts of @entity26 . a far cry from the @entity29 and traditional waterfront buildings of @entity32 canal , this willfully eclectic venue might be considered the world 's most surreal public space . stretching along a half - mile - long cycle route , @entity19 is a colorful exercise in community building born from a collaboration between residents and some of @entity41 's most experimental architects . i start my exploration of @entity19 's three distinctive zones with a slice of @entity46 . at the top of the zone known as @entity49 stands a 14 - meter - tall pole with a giant " donut " and a neon sign . it hails from a restaurant in @entity55 and looks like something conjured in a dream by a salivating @entity58 . @entity60 highway setting when viewed from a distance , the doughnut sign and shiny logos from the car dealerships across the road create the perfect tableau for an @entity60 highway setting . heading south into the park , i 'm greeted by a large cast iron bull , a tribute to the famous @entity72 sherry trademark . next up is a basketball court that sits in a bowl - shaped concrete structure . the court is modeled on @entity77 's @entity76 , a venue once used by the militant @entity80 group to launch assaults on @entity83 's presidential palace , and which now serves as the training facility for the country 's national basketball teams . then there are all the smaller objects , which i initially walk straight past but which @entity19 's smartphone app guides me to via an interactive map . there are trash cans from the @entity95 seaside resort of @entity96 , drains from @entity97 , a manhole cover from @entity99 and seven different types of bike racks from across @entity41 . it 's a multicultural onslaught . some of the objects in @entity19 are originals while others are replicas designed so that they comply with @entity26 regulations for playground materials and public spaces . the items were chosen after canvassing local ideas online and at community meetings . residents were n't required to pick objects from their place of birth -- some were inspired by treasured vacation spots -- but the idiosyncratic output reflects the diversity of a neighborhood made up of people from 60 nationalities . world expo @entity19 is a collaboration between the artist group @entity126 , @entity128 - based landscape architects @entity126 and @entity26 architects @entity130 - @entity130 . @entity131 has masterminded some of the most ambitious and left field ideas in @entity23 , including a public swimming pool in the harbor and a plan to turn an incinerator into a ski slope . " with @entity19 , we had to find a way of utilizing the diversity in the local population , " says @entity139 of @entity130 - @entity130 . " rather than just have the same @entity23 bench you will see in any other park , why not involve the local residents to source the best items from across the globe and almost create a world expo ? " a good example stands at the end of the @entity153 -- it 's a grassy mound with a small patch of naked , reddish soil . the soil comes from different towns of the @entity159 territories and was brought here by two young @entity23 women who traveled to the @entity162 . i stand near the soil and use the smartphone app to watch a film about how the women used their hands , rocks and small plastic bags to gather the material . " when we travel as @entity159 , " says one of the the women , @entity179 , in the video , " we gather soil so you can take a piece of @entity176 back home to @entity26 . " on this breezy morning , a group of schoolkids have gathered on top of the mound on an assignment to plot park objects on a world map as they explore the area . when their teacher gives them the go - ahead , they scamper down a slope covered in zebra - striped asphalt . the stripes lead to the asphalt - covered @entity196 , the second part of @entity19 . local residents were initially irked when they found out grassy areas of the park would be paved over , but the @entity196 is the most visually exciting aspect of the project . judging by the crowds who gather here and take photos , it 's also one of the most engaging . other items here include a @entity211 fountain , chess tables from @entity213 and a giant plastic octopus from @entity215 that doubles as a slide . " the fountain on the @entity196 works incredibly because it 's star - shaped , " says @entity139 . " when parents are watching their kids play in the water or sliding down the octopus , the parents are seated across from each other , so they end up talking together rather than just sitting in a circle looking away . " bulls and @entity10 boxing the final part of @entity19 is the @entity228 , complete with neon signs for a @entity231 hotel and a beauty shop in @entity233 . it 's the most bustling part of @entity19 and takes the park right down to @entity22 's busiest street . teenage boys play - fight in the @entity10 boxing ring while daycare children sway on the @entity17 - inspired swing benches . @entity241 of the adjacent building have been painted red to match the color of the surface , but some the purple - tinted patches on the ground have faded . the area is due to be refurbised next year to enhance the color scheme and to make the surface more slip - resistant for pedestrians and cyclists . not all of @entity19 is resistant to wear , tear and the effects of time . some objects , such as the lone steel bull , feel incongruous and random . however , when seen as a whole , this strange bubble of world exposition and local community is a cohesive experience . there have been honors for @entity19 , including a nomination for the prestigious 2013 @entity266 architecture prize . its real triumph , however , lies in its ability to engage people in its surreal world , whether they 're chess players deep in contemplation on the @entity196 , moody teenage students having gym lesson at the @entity13 " muscle beach " or toddlers sliding down an octopus from @entity215 or an elephant from @entity5 . @entity280 is a freelance journalist and author based in @entity23 who writes about all aspects of @entity284 culture . he previously spent six years in @entity285 working for the @entity286 .
