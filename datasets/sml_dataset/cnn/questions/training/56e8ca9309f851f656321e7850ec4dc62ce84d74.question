( @entity0 ) -- dr. @entity1 and his brother , dr. @entity1 , have been called pioneers for their community - based approach to @entity6 and @entity7 in @entity8 . since opening a hometown clinic in 1999 , the men have been raising awareness about @entity6 , dispelling myths about the virus and treating people who are shunned because of it . they have also reached out to their neighbors in @entity17 and @entity18 and worked with medical universities in @entity20 and the @entity21 . but in 2008 , the @entity22 were arrested by the @entity8 government . according to @entity24 , they were charged with " communication with an enemy government " and for trying to " overthrow the government . " @entity24 says the charges had no merit , but he and his brother were found guilty and thrown into @entity8 's notorious @entity30 . @entity24 served most of a three - year sentence and was released in october 2010 . his brother is still behind bars . @entity0 's @entity33 recently caught up with @entity24 to talk about his work , his prison sentence and his relentless campaign for his brother 's freedom . @entity33 : what it is like to be an @entity6 doctor in @entity8 today ? dr. @entity1 : i ca n't answer for every doctor . but for my brother and i , it was about helping people and making a contribution to the public . we wanted to do it regardless of the country 's political situation or whether or not our efforts were recognized . in @entity8 , there 's also a stigma ( against people with @entity6 and the condition it causes , @entity7 ) . we wanted to make sure patients are not isolated and are not discriminated ( against ) . @entity33 : how do you reduce the social and cultural taboos associated with it ? @entity65 : it is not easy . the " a-ha " moment for me came in 1997 when i met a 19 - year - old patient from @entity71 seeking treatment in @entity8 . he was isolated in a small unit , and when i asked the nurses why he was isolated , they said , " he has @entity7 , he 's scary . " for me , that was the turning point . i started to talk to my brother about how we can change perceptions . we set up our first clinic in my hometown of @entity83 , where people knew and trusted us , and we had a lot of contacts . our goal was to create a clinic where everyone can come . ... we did n't want our patients to get labeled by others for coming to " an @entity7 clinic , " so we provided our services in a known reproductive and family planning center . only we knew the reasons people came in . @entity33 : how much freedom and support did you have from the government to be able to do what you wanted to do ? @entity65 : we had the support of the president of a medical university because in @entity8 , the system of public health care is part of the medical university system . we also had the support of his deputy , who was the commissioner of health for the province . that was a great start . we engaged not just the patients , but their families . we talked to them about how @entity6 can be transmitted , what was true and what was a myth . we involved the local policymakers , clergies and religious leaders . once we gained people 's trust , our cases increased from one to two a week to 60 to 80 per day in six months . @entity33 : what about financial help ? @entity65 : in the beginning , we struggled . we ran the clinic mostly on contributions from the local community , the university and volunteers . but later on , we got funding from the @entity135 . they support the fight against hiv / aids , tuberculosis and malaria . @entity33 : you 've been called pioneers , and your work has been called revolutionary -- a model for the rest of the @entity146 . can you explain your approach ? @entity65 : our approach was community - based . we wanted to inform , involve and engage different parts of community . we wanted to provide everything in just a one - stop shop of sorts : prevention , treatment and social support , all in one place . in the @entity21 and @entity161 countries , patients usually seek medical treatment in one place and counseling in another place . but in @entity8 , we only had one chance to make a difference . because these patients come for the first time , it may be the only time they come . so you have a one - time opportunity to keep them motivated so they can continue their treatments . @entity33 : how did the 2005 election of president @entity178 change things for you ? @entity65 : when we began our work in @entity7 in 1997 , there was a positive atmosphere to implement our ideas . when the new administration came , there was less focus on @entity7 and the high - risk groups . it did n't seem to be a priority . @entity33 : let 's talk about your trip to @entity8 that landed you and your brother in jail . why would they arrest two doctors who were doing so much good ? @entity65 : i still have n't figured that one out . we were doing a lot of work outside @entity8 . we started helping our neighbors , @entity17 and @entity18 . we also started to collaborate with universities in @entity20 and the @entity21 . we got involved with @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 . i have to be clear . all our work was focused on health and science . it was never about politics . when we were arrested , i was shocked and i thought they must have the wrong people . @entity33 : what were the charges ? @entity65 : for the first seven months , there were no formal charges . later we were charged with " communication with an enemy government " and for trying to " overthrow the government . " none of it was true . we had done nothing wrong . @entity33 : how do you feel about the fact your brother is still in jail and you 're out ? @entity65 : it 's the worst feeling . i wish sometimes i was in prison and he was out . but if we were both in prison , we could n't help each other . now that i 'm out , i can campaign to raise awareness about his case . we 've been lucky and privileged to have so much support from the international community . we were recently honored by the @entity241 with the prestigious ( @entity243 ) award for @entity244 . i also got the opportunity to talk about my brother and his contributions at an international @entity7 conference in @entity249 last month . @entity33 : do you think talking about your brother 's case could hurt his case instead of helping it ? @entity65 : this is a very difficult question , and something i struggled with . it 's one of the reasons i decided to say nothing for months after my release . my brother is halfway through serving his sentence , and we 've heard nothing . so i feel i have a responsibility to raise awareness about his case . @entity33 : what are your plans for the future ? do you want to go back to @entity8 ? @entity65 : my immediate concern is my brother . i wake up wondering what 's he 's doing and how he 's holding up . my heart is with him . i try to focus on my work as a scientist and finishing my doctorate at the @entity281 . as far as going back to @entity8 , i have nightmares of being back in prison . it depends if i can be useful in helping @entity6 patients . predicting government reactions in @entity8 is difficult . i would love to go , but at this time i would think that i can not go . but it does not stop me working on this issue . @entity33 : what is the biggest lesson you 've learned from this process ? @entity65 : if you believe in what you are doing and love it , never give up , never get discouraged . even in my darkest hours in solitary confinement , knowing we had helped so many patients gave me hope and the will to continue .
