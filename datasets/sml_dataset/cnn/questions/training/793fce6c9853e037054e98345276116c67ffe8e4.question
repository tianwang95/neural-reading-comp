( @entity0 ) -- this weekend , @entity2 's @entity1 will attempt to become the first manager in history to win three @entity6 titles when his side face @entity8 at @entity9 . the achievement , which would match the late @entity12 's @entity6 feat with @entity13 in the 1970s , is not only a testimony to @entity1 's run of success since taking over at @entity17 in 1986 , but also continues the remarkable legacy that @entity20 managers continue to have on football as a whole . from @entity1 to @entity23 , @entity24 to @entity25 , @entity26 to @entity27 , the impact that @entity20 managers have had through the years is so great that it has changed the course of history for some major football institutions . earlier this month , @entity1 , the son of a @entity34 shipbuilder , guided @entity2 to a record 19th @entity36 league title , with all but two of those successes coming under the guidance of either @entity1 or @entity23 -- whose five league titles would surely have been many more but for the 1958 @entity42 air crash which decimated his " @entity44 " squad . @entity13 's period of dominance in @entity36 and @entity48 football began when @entity25 -- who was born and raised in a tiny @entity50 mining village -- took over in 1959 , helping the club to three league titles , a feat matched by compatriot and current @entity55 incumbent @entity24 . @entity56 had spent 18 years in the football wilderness before @entity26 , the youngest of seven children brought up by his mother after his father died when he was still a baby , took over and led the club to two titles in three seasons in 1989 and 1991 . and the legendary @entity27 , another to be brought up in a coal mining community , led @entity66 to become the first ever @entity68 winners of the @entity6 in 1967 , with @entity23 guiding @entity2 to victory the very next year . the trend for successful @entity20 managers has now spanned seven decades and @entity73 , the director of football development at the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) , told @entity0 that he believed the continued success of his compatriots was no coincidence . " @entity20 people , by nature are hard workers -- they are grafters , are open minded , and traditionally looking to better themselves , " said @entity73 . " it is a @entity20 trait , but particularly from the @entity34 area . many of these successful managers come from that part of @entity20 . it is a very working class and hard working region of the country , " he continued . " i do n't know why so many successful managers come from @entity20 , but the traditional values and ideals that are instilled into people definitely help . " it is significant that not as many managers come from the more middle class @entity98 area , where , traditionally , the financial industry would get most of its workforce from . " the figures back up @entity103 's claim . out of the last 26 seasons , 18 @entity36 titles have been won by @entity20 managers , compared to just two by @entity107 , a remarkable statistic . and when the @entity112 season finished on sunday , seven managers from the @entity34 area were sitting in the dug - out , with @entity113 arriving next season following @entity116 's promotion to the top tier . former @entity20 international @entity118 , who was a member of @entity1 's successful @entity120 side , prior to his move to @entity2 , before later becoming a @entity112 manager in his own right at @entity124 , endorsed @entity103 's view . " i think the people of @entity34 are different and unique compared to the rest of @entity20 , " @entity118 , himself a native @entity127 , told @entity0 . " despite the success of these managers they are not pretentious or big time and maintain a sense of reality and humility , which i believe is a huge factor to getting the best out of players . " what @entity1 does in particular is manage to get players to believe that he feels things personally . so , if you play badly , you are letting him down as a person , as well as the team , and his players really bought into that ethic , " added @entity118 . another major factor in the development of @entity20 coaches and managers has been the rise in prominence of the @entity20 national training center in @entity154 , on the @entity50 coast . the @entity75 run a number of @entity158 coaching courses at the academy and many top @entity20 managers , past and present , have passed through its doors at one time or another , as well as many other leading coaches worldwide including @entity166 's @entity165 and @entity167 of @entity168 . " i do n't think the academy has been the primary reason for the success of @entity20 coaches and i do n't think we can take credit for their achievements , " said @entity73 . " but we have had @entity27 and @entity1 , as well as many other top coaches , giving seminars here , and that knowledge and expertise must rub off . " @entity181 coaches come here and they know they must sacrifice having their summer off , learning from experienced tutors and mentors , " he added . " at the end of the day , a coaching diploma is no guarantee of success but it is a confirmation of professional competence , and hopefully the techniques learned at @entity154 have helped them along the way . " @entity118 was another coach who spent time at the @entity154 training center , and he too believes the skills he learned there went some way to his success as a coach . " the mentors on the courses encouraged us to learn different skills , to think outside the box , " said @entity118 . " we were forever being challenged to think of new ideas with the principle being that the skills we were being taught was only the beginning of our coaching journey . " in my case , i found it a ground - breaking and modern way of learning . we had coaches from all over the world on our course and the @entity75 seem to be some years ahead of their @entity36 counterparts in the development of coaches . " and the biggest example of @entity118 's view is @entity1 himself . come saturday night , one of the greatest coaches football has ever seen could be out on his own as the number one of all time .

@entity1 one of many @placeholder managers to have succeeded in @entity36 and @entity48
