@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- rep. @entity3 ' life is like a well - conducted orchestra : everything happens on cue in precisely the right note . that 's on most days . but other days she readily admits things do n't always happen so smoothly . " there are n't enough hours in the day . you always want more time , " @entity3 says . " that 's the continual challenge . " @entity3 is one of 76 women in the @entity15 . she 's the only woman in the @entity15 @entity17 leadership and has been mentioned as a possible running mate for @entity19 . elected in 2004 to represent the 5th @entity20 in eastern @entity0 , @entity3 has climbed the ranks in @entity22 , serving on the @entity23 and as vice chair of the @entity25 . but like many , her work is only part of what defines her . @entity30 in her life are her husband , @entity32 , and their two children , 18 - month - old @entity34 and @entity35 , 5 . @entity3 holds the distinction of being the only member of @entity22 to give birth twice while in office . one friday morning , she invited @entity1 into her home as the family was getting ready for the day . like many working moms , she juggles the responsibility of a demanding career and duties of home life . her husband scrambles eggs on the family 's kitchen island countertop , while the congresswoman sits down next to her daughter . " do you want some help ? you want some help today , " she asks @entity34 , taking the spoon . " there you go . is that good ? how about a little egg ? " she asks . on the other side of the kitchen table sits @entity35 . in front of him is a piece of paper with alphabet letters . he carefully reproduces the letters as his mom helps him sound them out . " he 's doing well . he 's learned his letters . he knows the sounds to the letters and he knows all the uppercase . we 're working on the lowercase , and he 's starting to read , which is really exciting , " she says . early years voters in @entity0 have been able to follow the personal life of @entity3 . she worked on her family 's orchard near @entity84 , @entity0 . she 's the first in her family to graduate from college , working her way through @entity89 in @entity90 . in 1994 , at age 25 , she was elected to the @entity92 . a decade later , she arrived in the nation 's capital to serve in the @entity15 . " i was first elected to @entity22 in 2004 and i was still single . i wondered maybe i would be single for the rest of my life , " @entity3 said . " and then i met @entity32 . we got married a year later , and soon after that i was pregnant . @entity35 was born in 2007 , and @entity34 was born in 2010 . " @entity32 is a retired @entity99 commander , serving 26 years in the service . his father was mayor of @entity102 in the early 1970s . family challenges when the couple found out they were expecting , they were both thrilled to be first - time parents . " it was exciting to know i was going to become a mom . there 's so much involved in becoming a mom , and it 's such a special time , " @entity3 said . her pregnancy was uneventful until her eighth month when doctors said an ultrasound had revealed a blockage in her baby 's small intestine . " they told us , @entity32 and me , you should know that one out of three babies with this condition is born with @entity123 . " they did n't have much time to process the news . the next day @entity3 went into premature labor . " it was certainly on the forefront of our minds all during labor . it was ok , does my little baby have down syndrome ? " @entity35 was born at five pounds , nine ounces . it was n't immediately apparent if he was born with @entity136 21 , the extra chromosome associated with @entity123 . three days later the family received confirmation . " boy , that 's tough news to receive . it 's not what you dream . it 's not what you expect . yes , you 're very excited to be a mom , and yet you 're faced with a lot of the unknown . i think it 's the fear of the unknown that is overwhelming at that point in your life , " @entity3 said . personal cause since receiving the news , she has received a lot of support from her constituents and people in the disability community . " i believe my eyes have been open . i just view life from a totally different perspective . i was welcomed by the disability community , and they see the best in what every person has to offer . " her initial fear has been replaced with resolve . in 2008 , she co-founded the bipartisan @entity174 . she has taken up a leading cause of the disability community , co-sponsoring a bill called the achieving a @entity178 . it would modify the @entity181 code to allow parents of children with disabilities to set aside money in tax - free accounts for future education , housing and transportation needs . the accounts would be modeled after current 401 ( k ) retirement and 529 college plans . " we have hopes and dreams for @entity35 , and we want him to be all that he can be , and we want to give him the strong foundation so that he can pursue a job and hopefully independent life , " @entity3 said . @entity32 added , " like any parent , you want them to reach their highest potential . " life as mom " @entity35 , do you like music ? can you put music on , " @entity3 asks . @entity35 reaches for a cd . " oh , oh , " she says , glancing at her husband . " he has @entity209 . he loves @entity210 . it 's just a little loud for the morning . " @entity35 starts rocking out on the couch , his blond hair shaking to the music , while his sister bounces nearby . the family made the decision to enroll @entity35 in a public charter school in @entity0 . on normal days the kids wake up early around 6:30 a.m. " they 're a nice alarm clock . they kind of take turns getting up , " she says smiling at her two children . she and @entity32 both pitch in helping get the children dressed and ready for the day . @entity32 leaves to take @entity35 to school , which starts at 8:45 a.m. , and the congresswoman has some one - on - one time with her daughter . when @entity32 returns , she heads off to her @entity232 office . he stays home with the kids . " i spent 26 years in the @entity99 . so this is a lot like the @entity99 , " he jokes . " it 's dynamic , it 's interesting and there 's a purpose to it . " the congresswoman shuttles back to her district in @entity102 on weekends . sometimes she takes the kids with her . her mother lives there and is happy to see the grandchildren . finding time to get it all done is n't easy . but the couple try . " thursday night is date night . so when i 'm in town and do n't have votes , we have date night . ... that 's our night , " @entity3 said . life may get even more topsy - turvy for @entity3 . her name comes up repeatedly as a possible vice presidential pick for @entity19 , the presumptive @entity17 presidential nominee . the family deals with it by trying to be as flexible as possible . " the schedule is always changing , fluid . we try to schedule things as much as possible in advance . but there 's always things coming up . fortunately , they 've been pretty good travelers . they do n't know any differently . " revving up for another campaign season , @entity3 says she 's ready . " this will be the first campaign season for @entity34 . " and @entity35 -- expect to see him charming the crowds . " he loves parades . he loves to be in a parade and wave and dance to music . he 's a natural .
