editor 's note : in our @entity5 series , @entity3 correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , @entity11 describes speaking with @entity13 leader @entity12 in a secret location in @entity15 , @entity16 . @entity13 leader @entity12 hinted to @entity3 at a potential shift in the group 's policy toward @entity20 . @entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity3 ) -- sitting in a room with the top @entity13 leader -- a man @entity20 would prefer dead -- is not an easy feeling , knowing that at any second a missile could shatter the building , killing everyone inside , myself included . and , of course , it is no surprise why @entity20 has @entity12 at the top of its hit list . he is known to have ordered bombings that have targeted @entity20 civilians , blowing up cafés , markets and malls across @entity20 . @entity3 senior correspondent @entity38 and i recently sat down with @entity12 in a secret @entity13 " safe house " in the middle of @entity15 . the walls were adorned with the pictures of @entity13 members who have carried out suicide bombings that have killed hundreds of @entity20 . we sipped coffee uneasily as we waited for @entity12 to emerge for an interview that was more than three years in the making . suddenly and without warning , the @entity13 leader appeared . dressed in a suit , he smiled as he greeted us . " you are more than welcome , " he said in broken @entity53 , a common phrase you hear in the @entity56 . he then explained he was more than willing to discuss anything we wished , ranging from a captive @entity20 soldier to the peace process to @entity62 foreign policy . the still abducted @entity20 soldier , cpl. @entity63 , was a key part of the interview , and @entity12 was more than willing to talk about him . watch @entity12 talk about @entity63 » " we did not blackmail @entity20 , and we gave free information to @entity63 's father and his family that @entity63 is still alive . when he asked us to bring him a medical glasses for his sight , we did so as humanitarian duty . we treat @entity63 in a humanitarian way that is in line with the @entity76 ' morals , " he said . read @entity20 father reject @entity13 claim @entity38 began to ask about @entity13 ' view of the @entity62 and the @entity82 administration 's foreign policy . suddenly , @entity12 hinted at a potential shift in @entity13 ' policy toward @entity20 . the slightest chance of change , of course , depends on events , according to the @entity13 leader . " @entity13 changed a lot and great efforts have been made to conform with the realistic positions of @entity76 and @entity93 . when @entity13 says with other @entity76 forces that we demand for a @entity76 country as the border was back in 1967 . is n't this a development change ? " he said . shortly after the interview began , the room filled up with his guards and those that work with @entity12 . they wanted to hear what he had to say as much as we did . in the middle of the interview , one of his guards handed him a cell phone . he had a brief conversation and apologized to us for the interruption . " who was that ? " i asked one of my contacts . the answer : " a very powerful @entity93 leader . " i asked , " who ? " my contact shook his head . it was clear at that moment , i would never know who it was that called . during the interview , it was impossible not to look at our surroundings . this was a safe house where the leader of @entity13 avoids assassination attempts . the safe house was a simple building . it reminded me of something one of my @entity13 contacts said to me weeks earlier in a neighboring country , " i am just a poor man , serving a cause i know to be just . " there were two levels to this safe house -- upstairs was a reception room with elaborate decorations , framed pictures of the late sheik @entity149 and the @entity150 . the lower level of the safe house was only three rooms . only the basics exist in the place . a few tables , couches and plastic chairs . @entity13 security was everywhere -- checking everything and keeping a keen eye on us . just a request to use the bathroom involved an escort . @entity12 is a complicated , calculating man . to his people , he is seen as a humanitarian and as the leader of @entity13 . to @entity20 , the @entity62 and a list of other nations , he is seen as a terrorist . @entity20 has openly blamed him for terror attacks across their country . they also say he is responsible for the abduction of @entity63 . on june 25 , 2006 , @entity63 was abducted by @entity13 . three days later , @entity20 flew four jets over @entity16 president @entity177 's palace -- a clear message to both @entity16 and @entity12 . @entity179 , the former prime minister and current president of @entity20 , blamed @entity12 , marking him as a prime target on @entity20 's strike list . not necessarily a surprise -- they have tried killing him before . next month will mark the 10 - year anniversary of an assassination attempt on @entity12 's life by the @entity20 intelligence organization @entity188 . while @entity12 was living in @entity190 in 1997 , @entity188 agents breached the building in which he was sleeping . they injected poison into his ear . the @entity190 authorities quickly discovered what had happened and through pressure from both the @entity190 king and some @entity62 officials , @entity20 eventually provided @entity12 with the antidote he needed to survive . " i am 51 years old , and the past 10 years have been a gift from above , " he told @entity3 . which is why he now resides in @entity16 , living in an undisclosed location , using a variety of secret safe houses from which he leads @entity13 . when he speaks , @entity76 and @entity20 equally listen to every word , because he may be the only man who can assure the @entity76 will honor a cease - fire with @entity20 if one is ever agreed upon . he has led @entity13 ever since an @entity20 missile literally split @entity13 's spiritual leader @entity149 in half , killing him in downtown @entity211 in 2004 . of course , because he is such a target , gaining access to @entity12 is nearly impossible , especially for a @entity215 news organization . why he agreed to talk to @entity3 at this moment remains a mystery to me . but after months and years of persistence , the day had finally arrived . @entity38 and i met in @entity15 . we started friday in a hotel lobby , with a member of @entity13 sitting at a table with the two of us . as is tradition in the @entity93 world , we had a cup of coffee while talking with this man , one of my @entity13 contacts . our phones and @entity233 were surrendered -- all electronic equipment except the cameras handed over , put into bags , and our names written on the bags . from the hotel , we were escorted through the streets of @entity15 , winding our way through narrow streets , constantly looking in the rear - view mirror . suddenly the car stopped and we were hurried inside . the security was as tight as it could possibly be . we were searched thoroughly . " it 's not that we do n't trust you . it 's that you may not know who has been tampering with your things , " one of the @entity13 members said . the interview with @entity12 lasted around 90 minutes , but it seemed to fly by far faster . he discussed the role of @entity255 and how @entity13 ' relationship plays into wider regional politics . he spoke of mistakes he believes the @entity62 have made -- especially not backing the @entity13 government in @entity211 , which was democratically elected -- and much , much more . " @entity20 is even destroying the interests of [ the ] international community and for this i believe that the @entity62 should change their policy and to knock the right door . @entity62 is still knocking the wrong door , " he said . i know one thing for sure : everyone he mentioned and spoke of will listen carefully to each word he said . palestinians and the @entity93 world will cling to his words , but perhaps his most captivated audience will be the state of @entity20 . e-mail to a friend
