( @entity1 ) -- " @entity2 " viewers had a clear choice when it came down to the final decision : the low - key but sincere @entity7 or the flamboyant and powerful @entity5 . " @entity2 " winner @entity7 , left , and runner - up @entity5 say they 're good friends . the vote went for @entity7 , and @entity5 told @entity11 on @entity1 's " @entity12 " that the outcome did n't surprise him . there are no hard feelings , though . @entity7 , @entity5 , @entity16 and the other seven finalists spoke of their friendship and camaraderie on " @entity12 . " here is an edited transcript of the interview . @entity11 : i think the first thing you said [ after being announced as the winner ] was " @entity5 's great . " actually on the air , you were complimenting him at the moment you should be complimenting yourself . @entity7 : i think that 's kind of how i am . seriously , we 're really good friends and he 's amazing . he 's been probably the most consistent performer this year , and just overall probably one of the best performers that 's ever been on the " idol " stage . watch @entity7 heap praise on @entity5 » @entity11 : so aside from getting more votes , why do you think you won ? @entity7 : i do n't know . i think it was a combination of a lot of stuff . it was maybe , probably , a little bit of personality , a little bit of -- hopefully it was about the music , as well . i know that 's not always the case on " @entity2 . " that 's what i care about the most : the music and how i portray it . @entity11 : it 's no secret that you 're a man of faith , that you referred to the " @entity59 thing , " as it were . you did n't rely on the @entity59 vote . do you think that played a part in your win , though ? @entity7 : i hope it did n't . because i guess me and @entity5 were doing an interview before the show : " @entity7 , do you think you 're going to get the @entity59 vote now that @entity16 's gone ? " and that was rough , that was kind of upsetting , because the show 's not about religion . we 're not running for president . we are there to do music and there to sing , and hopefully people vote on that . @entity11 : i 've seen the show 300 - plus episodes , and i know that you have to develop some sort of strategy . so what was yours ? @entity7 : i think my strategy throughout the whole thing was , ' do n't steer away from what you know how to do . ' and that 's just go out there and be yourself . i went out there and i played my type of music . and i really wanted to change stuff up a little bit and be kind of bold in my music choices , and just do what i believed in . @entity11 : you guys have been through it . the question everyone wants an answer to , finally i get to ask you . what kind of guy - liner do you wear ? @entity5 : i do n't know , whatever the make - up artist puts on me , you know . @entity11 : in that beat before i [ announced the winner ] , what were you thinking ? @entity5 : i kind of figured , ok , it 's anyone 's game at this point . i knew it was going to be a close race . and actually in my head , believe it or not , i went , that 's so @entity7 , it 's so going to be @entity7 . i felt it . @entity11 : you 're human , so you had to be let down a little bit . @entity5 : you know what ? i honestly mentally prepared myself for any possibility . and we kind of kept telling each other , you know , it 's such an honor to be here . we had so much fun last night . and tonight we got to sing with @entity133 . the point is not a title . the point is the opportunity . and i feel like we got that opportunity . watch the shock over the " idol " finale » @entity11 : so what do you think happened with the voting ? the judges called you the darling throughout the course of the season . and then you did n't get the first - place votes . what happened ? @entity5 : well , i 'm sure that when @entity16 was out of the competition , i think his fans probably would be more apt to go for @entity7 ' style . @entity7 : i think a lot of people thought that too . @entity5 : i was n't worried . i just assumed that would be the case . @entity11 : why ? @entity5 : @entity7 ' appeal is more like @entity16 's appeal than mine . i just kind of figured . @entity11 : does the fact that the judges pick you out early in the season hurt in the long run ? @entity5 : i kind of think it helped me because i think that because i 'm something a little bit different , it allowed people at home to feel it was ok to root for me . @entity11 : @entity7 , how did you size up the rest of the competition ? @entity7 : well , i think @entity5 and @entity16 were , i mean , very -- i think they were the front - runners for a long time . and they 're amazing . so kudos to them . i think they deserved it completely . but i never went out there to beat anyone . we talk about that a lot . @entity11 : i ca n't believe that totally . you never went out there to beat anyone ever ? @entity7 : no. how do you compare me or @entity5 or me or @entity16 or me or @entity189 or me or @entity191 ? @entity11 : i 've done the show for eight seasons and we 've never seen anyone quite like @entity5 . that 's great . that 's the beauty i think in the show . it can continue to reinvent itself with the contestants . @entity5 : that 's why i felt it was n't a competition thing . i knew it was apples and oranges . the people are like , i like that guy , i like that guy , or i like that girl . to me , it was like , go out there and do your best . that was the goal for me every week . do something new , do something new to get people talking . watch the " idol " finalists and @entity221 dish » @entity11 : @entity7 , how did you feel about the love @entity5 was getting from the judges during the season ? @entity7 : i thought he deserved it . i think he 's amazing . i think he was probably one of the most original and one of the most -- seriously , one of the best singers that 's been on " @entity2 " . @entity5 : this is why we 're friends . it 's real . @entity11 : let me ask you this : the speculation about your sexuality , do you think that had anything to do with coming in second place ? @entity5 : no , i think if anything , i think it -- i think my lifestyle is just i 'm different . i 'm a little bit -- i 'm not your typical guy next door . the guy next door versus the guyliner . sexuality aside , i think it more had to do with maybe my appearance and what songs i gravitated toward and my performance style . i think that had more to do with it . @entity11 : @entity7 , when i asked the question , you were nodding your head , why ? @entity7 : because i agree with him . it 's not about who he is or who i am . it 's about -- what we want , we want it to be about the music , you know ?
