@entity2 ( @entity1 ) diplomacy can be a lot like theater -- with a whole cast of characters jostling for spotlight and applause . on the world stage , @entity9 president @entity8 has emerged as a force to be reckoned with since he took the leading role in the world 's most populous nation in late 2012 . for the 61 - year - old @entity8 -- considered @entity16 's most powerful leader in decades -- his marquee appearance last november as the host of a global summit has offered good clues on his future moves . during the 2014 @entity23 in @entity2 , @entity8 met and entertained more than a dozen other leaders from countries that have been called @entity16 's friends , enemies and -- more often than not -- " frenemies . " no " frenemy " relationship is more important -- or complex -- than that between the @entity32 and @entity16 , the world 's reigning and emerging superpowers with huge bilateral trade as well as conflicting strategic goals . " it 's difficult to find space on containers -- ships are full even in normally slow seasons , " said @entity38 , an @entity32 buyer of lighting equipment based in southern @entity16 . his optimism on the rebounding @entity32 demand for @entity9 - made goods echoes the sentiment of many analysts , who see the world 's two largest economies cooperating more on the economic and trade front . tensions remain high , however , over geopolitical issues ranging from alleged state - sponsored cyber attacks , to territorial disputes involving what @entity60 views as @entity2 bullying its smaller neighbors . with @entity16 's defense budget growing at a double - digit rate annually , @entity8 -- who also heads the ruling @entity63 and the world 's largest standing army -- has n't been shy in showing off the country 's latest military wares , including its first aircraft carrier and a new generation of stealth fighter jets . @entity16 's fast - expanding global clout comes as the administration of @entity32 president @entity75 -- whom @entity8 met several times during the @entity77 gathering -- finds its hands tied by a host of other domestic and international issues . " @entity75 's famous ' pivot to @entity85 ' policy has been disrupted , " said longtime political analyst @entity81 with the @entity82 . " he is still keen to assert @entity32 supremacy in @entity87 -- so the @entity32 will continue to boost ties with @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 to form a wheel to contain @entity9 influence . " @entity94 , an international relations professor at @entity2 's @entity95 , predicts increasing confrontation between @entity2 and @entity60 - a worrying prospect as @entity8 is set to make his first state visit to the @entity32 in september . " the @entity32 government will have to decide whether it 's going to accept @entity16 's strategic interests in the @entity101 . " these interests include a group of tiny , uninhabited islands in the @entity105 , claimed by @entity16 as well as @entity106 , a key @entity32 ally in @entity85 . diplomatic ties between the two historical rivals had soured so much over the dispute that both sides resorted to invoking @entity112 , the fictional villain in the @entity114 books , in their heated rhetoric about each other . amid rising fears of potential military clashes , @entity8 finally agreed to meet @entity106 prime minister @entity119 during the @entity77 -- for the very first time since they took power in their respective countries . despite their now - infamous photo - op -- with @entity8 barely looking at @entity119 as they awkwardly shook hands in front of a sea of flashing cameras -- many others have managed to look beyond the two men 's frosty demeanors . " the two governments have resumed some senior - level talks -- that 's remarkable progress , " said @entity94 , the @entity9 professor in international relations . " but @entity16 will still confront @entity119 as well as talk to him -- it 'll do a combination of both . " indeed , while @entity9 foreign affairs and defense officials have attended recent bilateral talks in @entity106 , @entity2 has reportedly started building naval facilities in an island near disputed waters and also announced plans to hold a rare military parade in september -- with state media describing a major goal being to " frighten @entity106 . " besides @entity106 , though , @entity16 seems to have adopted a similar two - pronged approach in the @entity150 , where it is locked in a bitter territorial dispute with several @entity153 nations over another group of uninhabited islands sitting on resources - rich waters . " on one hand , @entity16 is trying to ease tensions ; on the other hand , it 's staking out bigger claims in the @entity150 , " said @entity158 analyst @entity81 . " some of @entity16 's nervous neighbors are asking : shall we call on the @entity32 to boost defense cooperation or shall we come to terms with the @entity9 ? " one neighbor that seems to be seeking a third option is @entity170 . long considered close @entity63 allies whose " great friendship cemented in blood " from the @entity172 , @entity16 and @entity170 have grown apart in the past decade with @entity174 's steadfast refusal to negotiate its nuclear disarmament . relations have become further strained after @entity8 came to power -- and recent reports by @entity16 's state media on @entity170 army deserters killing @entity9 civilians in border towns in several armed robberies have created a strong public backlash . " they keep demanding things from @entity16 and @entity16 has received very little in return , " said @entity188 , a former editor of an influential @entity63 journal who was once punished for calling on @entity16 to abandon the @entity174 regime . " this kind of one - way relationship is not sustainable , " he added , pointing to the lifeline @entity16 provides to @entity170 through energy supply and trade . " a new leader would certainly want to change this , especially because @entity170 -- which is like a spoiled brat -- ca n't change its ways . " breaking with tradition , @entity8 has yet to agree to a meeting in @entity2 with @entity170 's young supreme leader . @entity208 's first official overseas trip , instead , is reported to be a visit to @entity210 in may -- a sign of his effort to pursue other allies . " once he 's traveled around , @entity208 will realize @entity170 ca n't live without @entity16 , " predicted @entity188 . " they want to get close to @entity215 , but @entity215 has too many of its own problems to worry about . " like other great powers before it , @entity16 is facing more and more tough choices in international affairs . adopting the " carrot and stick " approach , @entity2 now dangles cash or flexes muscles in front of various countries -- and throws in a charm offensive starring its glamorous singer @entity228 when needed . as he amasses ever more power at home , a self - confident @entity8 has been expanding @entity16 's influence around the world , even in regions long considered out of its reach like @entity235 and @entity236 . " @entity8 is changing @entity16 's foreign policy , which will be much more proactive in the foreseeable future , " said @entity94 . " he 's very different from his predecessors -- he 's obviously more hardline . " as @entity16 prepares to usher in the @entity241 , which begins on february 19 based on the lunar calendar , few expect to see president @entity8 take any meek steps on the global stage in 2015 .

@entity16 and @placeholder have grown apart in the past decade , leader seen as " spoiled brat , " analyst says
