( @entity0 ) -- it 's 06:30am and the sun has just risen over the bustling gardens of @entity5 elementary school , in the coastal city of @entity7 , @entity8 . on this sunny morning , fits of giggles and screeches of laughter fill the hot and humid air , as would be expected in most schools around the world . but the source of fun is somewhat less expected -- farming . " i like to grow blackjack , fame flower , pumpkin leaves and sweet potatoes , " explains 11 - year old @entity19 in her native language of @entity21 . @entity26 is new to the world of agriculture and has enjoyed cultivating her favorite crops this morning . " i did n't know they were edible and now i know , i eat them . " in fact , she eats them for lunch , along with the rest of her school . @entity26 's school is putting @entity39 traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school meals . plants native to her home country , @entity8 , are being harnessed as a result of an idea pioneered by people at the other end of the age spectrum -- retired women -- the @entity52 ( @entity53 ) . " modern people here in @entity8 associate indigenous food with poverty and being poor , " says @entity53 founder @entity54 , referring to the increasing popularity of fast food . native plants such as blackjack , moringa , pumpkin , sweet potato and even the leaves of these latter two plants , have high nutritional and medicinal value . but , they 're under - appreciated by the communities in which they grow , often dismissed as weeds . setting new traditions one afternoon in 2007 , @entity74 invited her senior peers for tea which was made from the leaves in her garden . that day her mission to save gastronomic traditions began . and it began with children . " we started working with schools to make sure youngsters grow up valuing these vegetables , " says @entity85 , a @entity53 founding member . the children learn by growing and cultivating the plants at school and go on to spread the word to their families and communities . " they do n't know most of the time , especially people living in towns . " the elementary school at @entity5 has over 1200 students , all of whom appear to have come in at the crack of dawn to tend eagerly to their crops . there are groups of children tilling land , whilst others collect water from the well or wander around with watering cans . a final few harvest leaves and roots to be eaten for lunch that day . this is the atmosphere every morning , i 'm told . the garden spans one sixth of the school 's land and began development over three years ago . the school also has a kitchen on site for immediate preparation of the freshly - plucked ingredients . " in the morning session , normally we have time to clean the environment and take care of our garden , " says school headmistress , @entity128 . she has seen the impact the garden has had on the general health and well - being of her pupils . " it increased school enrollment and reduced dropout because the kids are happy to come in , " she says . @entity53 currently works with 10 schools in @entity7 , but hopes for the indigenous food movement to spread across the country . the need for improved nutrition among the 8 million children under five years old estimated to be living in @entity8 , 42 per cent are stunted and 16 per cent are underweight , according to @entity150 . levels of anemia are also high , with rates as high as 41 per cent in adult women . one cause of this is the increasing reliance on staples such as maize and sweet potatoes . another cause is that locals have been eating more food high in fat and sugars , such as burgers . plants with higher nutritional value , including the leaves of the sweet potato plant , seem to have been forgotten . improving diets is a national concern , but for the women at @entity53 , their goal is to get people appreciating the food directly under their nose . " in the villages , most of these vegetables grow as weeds , " says @entity85 , who worries that people do n't even seem to use them when they have nothing to eat . by raising awareness into growing indigenous plants , the team hope to get people harnessing these plants as year - round sources of food on their doorstep . it 's all in the taste as @entity85 wanders around the community garden at the @entity53 headquarters , she eagerly shows the tens of vegetable varieties growing there , one of her favorite being the bitter leaf . " you prepare it , wash it , cut it in small pieces , fry it and season it as you wish . it 's very tasty . " the leaves can also be consumed in the form of tea . utility and versatility appear to be commonplace . furthermore , the leaves of a sweet potato plant are high in protein , fiber , and minerals such as iron . the more local blackjack plant also contains vitamins and minerals and has traditionally been used as medicine to overcome anemia . insight into these plants , and many more , have been compiled into a recipe book put together in association with the slow food foundation for biodiversity , an @entity234 - based @entity233 promoting environmentally and culturally sustainable agriculture . the nutritional and medicinal value of indigenous plants is being forgotten across the continent and the slow food foundation now work in over 10,000 gardens in @entity39 , including @entity53 's headquarters . the movement to revamp and revitalize ancient plants has begun . it also appears to hold the secret to youth . as @entity85 explains the health benefits of improved nutrition , she grins and asks : " how old do you think i am ? " without a wrinkle on her face and the energy of someone in their prime , she reveals she is 74 years old . maybe that should be the opener to get anyone hooked . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @entity261 with @entity262 method : 1 . wash yams thoroughly and peel . wash again and cut into pieces the size of an egg . 2 . place yams in a saucepan of water that does n't quite cover them and put on the heat . 3 . @entity274 and chop onions , tomatoes and chili ( optional ) and add to the yams with salt ; cover and leave to boil . 4 . add oil or groundnut milk , continue to cook until yams are soft . 5 . add the washed vegetable leaves , cover and leave to cook until ready . recipe courtesy " cooking with traditional leafy vegetables -- indigenous plants in @entity8 's kitchen .
