@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- @entity3 was stumped . he had no idea what to give his father , evangelist @entity6 , for his 90th birthday friday . the rev. @entity6 speaks at a crusade in @entity9 , @entity10 , in october 2004 . suddenly , it dawned on him . " i have people who sometimes come up to me and say , ' @entity3 , i know i 'll never meet your father , but would you mind telling him that i got saved in his meeting in @entity18 in 1950 ? ' " the younger @entity6 said at the @entity12 in @entity0 , @entity1 . " i thought , wow , would n't it be something if everybody just wrote that little story down and gave it to him ? " so @entity3 turned to the @entity24 to help . for the past few months , people from around the world have been leaving personal messages for the elder @entity6 at @entity28 . the @entity29 says it has received tens of thousands of birthday greetings . read the messages " in 1995 , i was in between combat tours , " writes a @entity33 veteran . " i was in my barracks room one night , and i was seriously contemplating suicide . before cutting my wrists , a voice told me to put on the television . there you were preaching about why we should n't hurt ourselves that suicide was n't the answer . i was loved that night . " other well - wishers write about how @entity6 's ministry healed their marriages , reconciled families and led them to lives of service . at 90 , @entity6 remains " @entity52 's pastor . " in over 70 years of ministry , @entity6 has preached to more than 215 million people in person and in 185 countries . millions more have read his books and seen him on television . @entity6 has also prayed with and counseled every @entity52 president from @entity60 to @entity61 . after @entity62 won the presidential election , @entity6 issued an appeal on behalf of the president - elect : " i urge everyone to join me in pledging our support and prayers as he begins the difficult task ahead . " @entity72 presidential candidate sen. @entity71 visited @entity6 at his home over the summer . " he did n't ask for one thing except for water , " @entity3 said of the senator 's visit . " he said , ' dr. @entity6 , i 'd appreciate your prayer . if you 'd just pray that i 'd run an honorable campaign , ' and that 's all he asked . he did n't ask for my father 's support . " today , @entity6 spends most of his time in the remote western @entity1 mountain home where he and his wife , @entity88 , raised their five children : @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity88 , @entity93 and @entity94 . " there are a lot of miles on that body , " his daughter @entity88 said . " his world has become smaller . " he leaves his home only for doctor 's visits in @entity104 and an occasional @entity29 board meeting in @entity0 . it has been a difficult time for @entity6 . in summer 2007 , his wife , @entity88 , died after being bedridden for many years . the grief is still constant for @entity6 . " she was just one great woman . she has a lot of steel in her and a lot of determination . ... i just thank @entity115 that he chose her way off in @entity117 somewhere to come back to @entity52 and marry me , " @entity6 told @entity2 's @entity112 in one of his last television interviews in 2005 . @entity6 's family and associates say that his mind is sharp despite his age and that for a man who is 90 , he 's in good physical shape . " the lion still has a roar , " said @entity6 's spokesman , @entity124 . @entity6 exercises with a physical therapist on a regular basis and still swims and takes walks when he can . however , the fragilities of old age are also a reality . in october , @entity6 spent a night in the hospital after tripping over his golden retriever , @entity135 . a nurse stays with him around the clock . @entity6 uses a walker to get around . his hearing is failing . macular degeneration is stealing his eyesight . yet despite these obstacles , @entity6 continues his ministry . with the help of an assistant , @entity6 is writing another book about growing older . " i have discovered that just because we grow weaker physically as we age , it does n't mean that we must grow weaker spiritually , " @entity6 said in a statement this week . " in fact , we ought to be growing stronger spiritually , because our eyes ought to be on eternity and @entity153 -- on the things that really matter . " in many ways , these days @entity6 is making up for the years he spent on the road . " he really tried to stay in touch with us and be the kind of father that he wanted to be , " his daughter @entity88 said . " he has said that he 's frustrated that he was n't home for us when we were little . " his daughter @entity92 , a @entity166 , @entity1 - based evangelist , often stops by to read from the @entity167 and preach . @entity6 has often said she is the best preacher in the family . every sunday when he is in town , @entity3 has lunch with his father . they talk about the ministry and world events . @entity6 stays connected to the world by watching the news . @entity2 's " @entity179 " is part of his nightly ritual , @entity124 says . @entity6 often prays for the people he sees in the news . after a church shooting in december in @entity183 left five people dead , @entity3 says , his father was heartbroken . " he said , ' @entity3 , let 's pray for those families ' ... so i turned the television off , and @entity189 prayed for those victims , and that 's the side of @entity6 i do n't think people realize . " a family meal of @entity1 barbeque , including pulled pork and coleslaw , will mark @entity6 's birthday friday . all of @entity6 's children and most of his grandchildren and great - grandchildren will be there . it will be the first time @entity6 's children have all been together since their mother died . the following week , there will be a larger celebration with friends and people who have served with @entity6 . there , he will be presented with the book of birthday greetings from fans around the world . @entity6 's children say that despite his remarkable life , he is a humble man who does n't dwell on the past . " my father does n't look backwards , " his daughter @entity88 said . " he really does see that @entity115 was the one who did it , and he just happened to be in the room . "

@placeholder 's family says his mind is sharp and he 's in good physical shape
