president @entity0 on tuesday recognized the leading @entity2 opposition coalition as the legitimate representative of the country 's people , marking a " big step " in @entity8 engagement with the nearly two - year - old crisis . " we 've made a decision that the @entity12 is now inclusive enough , is reflective and representative enough of the @entity2 population that we consider them the legitimate representative of the @entity2 people in opposition to the @entity22 regime , " @entity0 told @entity14 's @entity13 . " so we will provide them recognition and obviously with that recognition comes responsibilities on the part of that coalition , " he said . " it is a big step . " read more : what will recognizing the opposition accomplish ? the @entity8 joins @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and the @entity35 in recognizing the opposition . the move will be a major psychological boost for the rebels , but it does n't mean @entity40 will be arming them anytime soon . the @entity8 announcement had been anticipated to occur at some point this week with a major meeting of governments supporting a transition away from @entity2 president @entity22 scheduled . secretary of state @entity47 , who was supposed to attend the @entity49 meeting in @entity50 along with more than 100 delegations from the @entity8 , the @entity52 , @entity54 nations and representatives of the @entity2 opposition , canceled her trip due to a stomach flu that hit her and a number of her staff . deputy secretary of state @entity61 will attend in @entity64 's place . " i think what you 'll see is a political decision to morally boost them ( the @entity2 opposition ) and provide more political and moral support for their efforts . and look at how we can financially assist the opposition moving forward , " according to an official who spoke to @entity76 before @entity0 's announcement , but declined to be identified because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue . " but again , i think you 're going to see a political recognition , not a legal recognition . " legally recognizing the @entity12 would carry more weight because the @entity8 would treat the opposition like an alternative government , said @entity85 , an expert on @entity49 and a senior fellow at the @entity87 . in order to do that , the @entity8 would have to determine that the opposition controls a majority of @entity2 territory and has taken over the country 's treaty obligations from @entity22 's government , neither of which has happened . read more : an afternoon with a @entity2 bombmaker even as it agrees to recognize @entity49 's opposition politically , @entity40 will still continue to deal with the @entity22 government in certain capacities . " it 's more of a political shot in the arm for the @entity2 opposition , " @entity85 said . " and it 's hoped that by doing that , it will straighten their backs and strengthen them and encourage them to come together and work together more effectively . " speaking before @entity0 's annoucement , @entity110 , senior associate in the @entity111 at the @entity112 , called the expected upgrade in relations with the opposition " overwhelmingly political , " a step that is " an attempt to encourage this positive trend , while at the same time isolating more radical actors in the opposition . " as part of @entity40 's effort to isolate extremist groups in @entity49 while boosting the new political coalition , the @entity125 on tuesday imposed sanctions on leaders of the jihadist @entity128 in @entity49 , after the @entity129 moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to @entity132 in @entity133 . @entity61 plans to meet with the @entity2 opposition during his trip to @entity136 . the intent is to " hear from them ... about how they see things going forward both in terms of their own internal organization about their connectivity with @entity2 inside @entity49 , about their transitional planning , about the needs that they see for external support , how they would have us best direct the non lethal support and humanitarian support that we are providing , " @entity129 spokeswoman @entity137 said on monday . the @entity8 has been looking for the opposition to establish a leadership structure , @entity137 has previously told reporters . officials said they have seen progress and that @entity64 " has been clear that we 'd like to offer them more support , " @entity137 said . that support , which already totals more than $ 200 million in funding and humanitarian aid , could be increased even more with this announcement . but would " support " include lifting the arms embargo on @entity49 , an idea that @entity33 supports ? @entity137 stuck this week with what the @entity8 has been saying for months : " we are maintaining our current posture of providing non-lethal support and not going beyond that . " the @entity8 is not ready to arm the rebels due to continued concern about extremist elements within their ranks . other countries , like @entity177 , are providing some weapons . any recognition of the opposition , however , raises issues with @entity182 , a crucial player in the @entity2 equation . the @entity182 were invited to participate at the @entity136 meeting but declined , according to the @entity129 . @entity186 has been highly critical of actions by the @entity2 armed opposition , even while expressing support for a political solution . the listing of @entity128 as a foreign terror organization is a step that @entity186 could welcome . @entity8 recognition of the opposition could anger @entity186 but it also could have a positive effect . @entity182 has warned that chaos could ensue if @entity22 is deposed . the @entity8 could use this recognition as a signal to @entity182 that the opposition council is moving toward becoming a viable government should @entity22 leave . the next steps in dealing with the @entity2 opposition leadership depend to a large extent on how that opposition continues to develop . @entity137 pointed to the process of recognizing the opposition in @entity208 as a template . recognition is just part of the process of trying to create a political solution for the @entity2 conflict . at the same time , the @entity8 is trying to urge @entity182 to use its influence with @entity216 to help bring about a political solution . that was the focus of recent meetings between the two countries facilitated by the joint special representative of the @entity222 and @entity223 for @entity49 , @entity224 . in a statement , @entity224 said the diplomats " explored avenues to move forward a peaceful process and mobilize greater international action in favor of a political solution . " @entity137 said on monday the question now is whether there are figures in the opposition who could come together . " perhaps there are folks who are currently in the government without blood on their hands who could support those kinds of democratic principles and form the basis of a transitional structure going forward , " @entity137 said . " mr. @entity224 thinks it is worth a try , " she added . " we want to support his efforts and we 'll have to see where that goes . "
