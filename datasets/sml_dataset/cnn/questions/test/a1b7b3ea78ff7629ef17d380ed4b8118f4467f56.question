@entity2 ( @entity1 ) president @entity0 says he is " absolutely committed to making sure " @entity3 maintains a military advantage over @entity5 . his comments to the @entity7 , published on sunday , come amid criticism from @entity3 prime minister @entity9 of the deal that the @entity11 and five other world powers struck with @entity5 . @entity13 agreed to halt the country 's nuclear ambitions , and in exchange , western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the @entity5 's economy . @entity0 said he understands and respects @entity9 's stance that @entity3 is particularly vulnerable and does n't " have the luxury of testing these propositions " in the deal . " but what i would say to them is that not only am i absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge , and that they can deter any potential future attacks , but what i 'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood , including @entity5 , a clarity that if @entity3 were to be attacked by any state , that we would stand by them , " @entity0 said . that , he said , should be " sufficient to take advantage of this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table , " he said . the framework negotiators announced last week would see @entity5 reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060 , limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections . the talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until june 30 . but @entity9 and @entity54 critics in @entity55 have complained that @entity5 wo n't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country 's leadership is n't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as @entity0 says they are . @entity0 said even if @entity5 ca n't be trusted , there 's still a case to be made for the deal . " in fact , you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us , all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they 're doing and that , for a long period of time , we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon , " @entity0 said .
