( @entity0 ) he would n't give his name . but the name tattooed on his neck -- @entity5 -- gave him away . that 's what @entity8 , @entity9 , sheriff @entity10 said saturday about @entity12 , the 23 - year - old convicted murderer turned jail escapee until his arrest overnight in @entity16 . authorities around @entity9 had been looking for @entity12 since early wednesday , when he jumped a correctional officer at @entity8 's @entity19 , then took off with the guard 's uniform and @entity22 . surveillance video was the last officials saw of @entity12 until just before midnight friday , in @entity16 . " they saw a guy that matched the description , " @entity10 said . " and if you 're in law enforcement very long , you just get a feeling that something 's not right . ... i think that 's what happened . " the suspect ran five city blocks before being tracked down , carrying a loaded handgun . he did n't go easily , refusing to identify himself . but when @entity16 police contacted their law enforcement counterparts about 60 miles south in @entity8 and told them about the tattoo , it became clearer who the man was . as @entity10 said of the @entity5 tattoo , " it 's not a common name to have around your neck . " fingerprints later confirmed that @entity16 police had indeed caught up with @entity12 . while not offering details beyond that no one is thought to have driven him north nor did a tipster call to specify his location , @entity10 did say " we have some ideas of where he went and how he ended up " in the @entity16 . it was n't immediately known either when @entity12 will return to @entity8 . but , when he does , the sheriff said the convict will likely face an attempted murder charge for his attack of the jail guard on top of his already extensive criminal history . murderer overpowers guard , drives off in his suv @entity10 said he expects that @entity12 will eventually be incarcerated outside @entity8 , in part because " you do n't want someone to raise " the idea that guards there might somehow seek retaliation for the attack on one of their own . what the sheriff does n't want is for @entity12 to go free ever again . this is a man , after all , who killed a man in a june 2013 botched robbery , had to be wrestled to the ground by bailiffs after his conviction in late february , then escaped jail after assaulting the guard . " he 's not going to walk down the block again , i do n't believe , " @entity10 said . the assaulted correctional officer remains in an @entity9 hospital , where his condition has improved and he 's been able to talk to fellow authorities . this qualifies as very good news , given that authorities think @entity12 " believed that he had killed that correctional officer by strangling him " around 3 a.m. ( 4 a.m. et ) wednesday , according to the sheriff . the guard was making his rounds when he was attacked from the side , then severely beaten and choked . @entity12 then allegedly disrobed the guard , a military veteran and 10 - year employee of the corrections department . the guard was left on the jail floor , going in and out of consciousness , for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard had n't responded to calls -- found him , the sheriff said . the alleged attacker then walked out of the jail , albeit only after having his identity checked by camera after pushing a button to notify " master control " that he wanted to leave . " we think that because he had the officer 's uniform on , " the sheriff explained this week , " that 's how he was able to effectively escape . " now that @entity12 is once again locked up , the focus has shifted more to how he left in the first place . opining that the escape would n't have occurred " if everybody had followed protocol , " @entity10 said it 's believed the inmate was n't in his cell at lockdown . " that 's where the big mistake happened , " the sheriff said . " someone missed that . and from that point on , things broke down . " @entity0 's @entity145 contributed to this report .

2 months after being convicted of murder , @entity12 escaped an @placeholder jail
