( @entity0 ) the @entity1 has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in @entity5 , where its new @entity6 faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . such state laws have been growing ever since the @entity1 @entity6 became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from " substantially burdening " a person 's exercise of religion . so far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . nonetheless , claims under those state @entity25 are " exceedingly rare , " and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not christian denominations , experts say . " there is reason to doubt whether these state - level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers , " wrote @entity31 law professor @entity30 in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an @entity49 accountant to a tea from the @entity51 : he was a @entity52 with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . but not in the eyes of the feds . in 2006 , @entity58 and @entity59 attended an @entity61 powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal @entity65 , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . @entity58 , a @entity71 , asserted he was participating in an @entity61 religious ceremony . the feathers are sacred to @entity61 . but a federal @entity75 agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and @entity58 surrendered his feathers . @entity59 , who is married to @entity58 's sister , is n't @entity61 and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the @entity81 . @entity58 , however , petitioned the federal @entity82 to return his feathers . the feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . @entity58 and @entity59 sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's @entity90 assertions and their claims under the federal @entity6 , the same 1993 statute that @entity5 legislators used in developing their new state law . but last august , the 5th @entity96 reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal @entity6 . on march 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to @entity58 . but the legal war is n't over . the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute @entity58 and his congregants , so @entity58 is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal @entity6 , said @entity110 , @entity58 's attorney who 's with the @entity111 . a tea used by a @entity114 faith is to them like wine used by @entity117 at communion , but @entity1 agents considered the brew an illegal drug . the religious organization @entity122 do vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the @entity51 that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the @entity129 . the religion is a @entity132 spiritist faith that originated in @entity114 and includes @entity51 and indigenous spiritual traditions . about 140 members of the church live in the @entity1 and use the tea in a sacred communion . in may 1999 , @entity139 agents entered the church headquarters in @entity141 , @entity142 , and seized all of its hoasca . the church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for @entity61 to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . in fact , the federal @entity6 was designed partly to protect the @entity61 ' use of peyote , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity154 . " they were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and @entity161 wanted to make sure it was protected , " @entity154 said of peyote and the 1993 law . the @entity122 do vegetal , which means " the union of the plants , " cited that federal law in suing the federal government . " the government has never explained why it has accommodated the @entity171 's use of peyote ( which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance ) but can not accommodate the @entity175 's use of hoasca , " the church said in a statement . the @entity1 @entity177 ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use . " the peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the @entity129 establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under @entity6 , " the court ruling said . @entity190 , an @entity191 prisoner in @entity192 , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no. so @entity190 sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the @entity199 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . @entity190 , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . the prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely " retaliation against the kosher inmates " if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . at least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . after losing before a magistrate , @entity190 won an appeal before the 11th @entity225 , which cited " the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why @entity192 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in @entity192 . " recently baptized in the @entity235 faith , @entity233 went to her job with the @entity49 in @entity237 in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9 - inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . @entity233 needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . but the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a " dangerous weapon " with a more than 3 - inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . @entity233 sued the government under the federal law . @entity233 cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5 - inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the @entity264 and the @entity111 . also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . in november , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of @entity233 's trial . the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the @entity273 reported . @entity233 's attorneys described the settlement as " a groundbreaking policy allowing @entity235 and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , " they said in a statement . invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . in @entity291 , an association of 40 churches called the @entity292 found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . the ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . in fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . so the pastors sued the city of @entity291 in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the @entity311 religious freedom statute , the federal @entity199 and the @entity1 @entity312 . but in 2003 , the 7th @entity96 upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their @entity199 claim . defeated , church leaders were angry . " the forty ( 40 ) churches in @entity292 and certainly people of all faiths throughout @entity291 are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the @entity199 passed unanimously by @entity161 in 2000 , " @entity320 , the group 's chairman , said in a statement . " also alarming is the court 's conclusion that @entity291 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . the majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing , " he said . at the same time , the city of @entity291 revised its zoning ordinance to avoid " the threat of heightened scrutiny under @entity199 , " according to a @entity342 report in 2002 . @entity0 's @entity343 contributed to this report .
