@entity1 ( @entity2 ) six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in @entity8 's southeastern @entity7 province sparked a huge fire , provincial authorities told state media . the plant , located in @entity13 city , produces paraxylene ( @entity15 ) , a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics . the blast occurred at an oil storage facility monday night after an oil leak , though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill . five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment , @entity26 news agency reported . more than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control , the @entity13 fire department wrote on their official microblogging account tuesday morning . residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to @entity40 to post photos of the fire . one user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors . the plant was hit by another explosion in july 2013 , although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time . though demonstrations are illegal in @entity8 , the construction of @entity15 plants has sparked protests , which have occasionally turned violent , in several cities in recent years . the @entity13 plant was slated for @entity57 -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country . however , it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current , more remote location .
