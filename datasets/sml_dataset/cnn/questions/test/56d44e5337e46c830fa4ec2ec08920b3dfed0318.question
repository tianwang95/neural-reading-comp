( @entity0 ) a hooded angel with black wings appeared on tuesday near the spot where @entity4 was shot and killed by a police officer in @entity6 , @entity7 , on saturday . since then , it 's been taken up as an icon of the @entity11 movement . when protesters held the winged figure at a wednesday morning rally outside @entity6 's @entity16 , the artwork was widely photographed . creator @entity17 grew up in the neighborhood where @entity4 , an unarmed black man , was shot in the back several times by a white police officer on saturday . @entity17 now lives in another part of the city and could n't stop thinking about it . he woke up about 3 a.m. a couple of days after @entity4 was killed and began searching for materials . " @entity26 is really about that moment . i just could n't take it any longer , " he said . @entity17 dug into the trash and found a piece of wood that was the perfect size . then he picked up a can of black house paint and started making the reclaimed wood into a work of art. the 56 - year - old said he crafted the artwork as a way of mourning with the family . " that 's who all this should really be about , not about the propaganda and making it your own story , " said @entity17 , who talks quickly and passionately about his subject material . " shooting him in the back and just the indignity of it all . " the figure , painted black in mourning for the family , has wings because it 's going to heaven , @entity17 said . the man depicted in @entity17 's piece is dressed in a hooded sweatsuit , though that 's not what @entity4 was wearing when he was killed . @entity17 said he prefers not to say too much about who the black angel figure is . people can look at the art and make their own interpretations , he said . " it 's a statement of where we are in @entity69 today . it 's relevant in @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , anywhere now . " after @entity17 put the piece up on tuesday near where @entity4 was killed , he got a call from a local protester with the @entity11 movement , which has staged protests around the country in the wake of high - profile deaths at the hands of police . the group asked for permission to use his artwork in its demonstrations at the @entity91 . @entity17 was happy to oblige . each day , the protesters call @entity17 and he either carries the angel - winged artwork to the protest , or the protesters come over to his home to pick it up . " it 's taken a life of its own , so i 'm letting it do what it 's supposed to do now , " he said . freelance photographer @entity103 spotted the artwork and wondered where it came from . @entity103 , who lives in nearby @entity71 , said the artwork made him feel sorrow for a life ended too soon . " it was very emotionally moving . it 's beautiful , " he told @entity0 . this is n't the first time @entity17 has used artwork to effect change : he restored a local theater to its former glory . he commemorated @entity119 's birthday by painting a mural in a bad neighborhood that needed light . @entity17 's wife , @entity123 , says her husband always paints from the heart . " to see this recognized , he just goes into tears because it 's very special to him . "

protesters from the @placeholder movement have started using it as his symbol
