( @entity0 ) nine of ten mostly foreign prisoners on death row in @entity3 have been given 72 hours notice ahead of their execution , according to a spokesperson for the attorney general 's office . " seventy - two hours notification means three days , at least , to go to the execution . it may be longer . in other words , there will be no execution less than 72 hours after notification , " @entity10 told @entity0 by phone sunday . though @entity3 officials said all 10 would be executed at the same time , @entity10 said @entity18 national @entity17 had filed a challenge to the @entity20 on thursday so his sentence has been delayed . meanwhile , @entity22 , a lawyer acting for @entity24 maid @entity23 , told @entity0 sunday that @entity23 had telephoned her sister on saturday at about 5:30 p.m. local time and said her execution will take place on tuesday , april 28 . officials at the @entity30 in @entity31 confirmed the same information . according to her lawyers , @entity23 unknowingly carried drugs into @entity3 , and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate . on friday , @entity3 officials advised relevant consular officials to travel to @entity3 's " execution island " -- @entity39 -- where the ten are being held -- a sign that the sentences may be carried out soon . they will face a firing squad . opinion : why executions wo n't win @entity3 's drug war the ten on death row , which also include two @entity52 citizens @entity53 and @entity54 -- members of the so - called " @entity56 " smuggling ring -- as well as prisoners from @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity3 , had their petitions for clemency denied by president @entity64 in late 2014 . a statement sunday from foreign minister @entity66 said the @entity52 government had been notified that the execution of @entity53 and @entity54 would be carried out " imminently . " " i spoke to mr. @entity54 's mother @entity71 yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from @entity3 president @entity64 for both men . " they have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes . " nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young @entity52 are executed . " i again respectfully call on the president of @entity3 to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency . it is not too late for a change of heart . " the two @entity52 , convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the @entity20 to hear their case . their lawyers have since filed another review at the @entity94 . the attorney general 's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options . @entity52 has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with @entity3 as a way of avoiding their deaths . on saturday , @entity106 secretary - general ban ki - moon called on @entity3 's government to reverse their decision . " the @entity113 appeals to the government of @entity3 to refrain from carrying out the execution , as announced , of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug - related crimes , " a spokesman for @entity110 said , according to various reports . meanwhile , @entity119 says president @entity64 " has an important opportunity to signal @entity3 's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution . " " @entity64 can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality , " said @entity127 , deputy @entity128 director at @entity119 , in a statement saturday . " president @entity64 should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment . @entity64 should promote @entity3 as a rights - respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment .
