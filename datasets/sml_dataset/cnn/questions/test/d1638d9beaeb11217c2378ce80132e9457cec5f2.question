( @entity0 ) laying down tracks for their debut album in the recording studio in @entity4 , @entity5 , 25 and her sister @entity6 , 27 could not be further from their hometown of @entity9 . the sisters were born in the @entity12 capital but were forced to flee after war broke out in 1991 . along with their parents , the girls relocated to @entity16 as refugees where during their teens they discovered a passion for music . heading south to @entity4 by way of @entity26 , the singing sisters with a bold flair for fashion are now embarking on a musical journey , gearing up to unleash their afro - pop sound to the world . @entity0 's @entity31 voices caught up with the sister act -- known collectively as @entity5 ( combining the translation of their names into @entity35 -- @entity36 means " @entity38 " and @entity6 means " arrow " ) to talk about music , aspirations and @entity12 . @entity0 : hi guys , thanks for chatting with me today . what are some of your musical influences ? @entity36 : we love @entity49 , @entity50 -- stuff my mom would listen to and play -- and the @entity53 . we used to die for the @entity53 . i love new artists now but i do n't know if it 's a nostalgia , but i remember ... my mom used to pump whatever -- @entity56 , @entity57 . @entity0 : you are working on your debut album now -- how 's that been ? @entity6 : we 've been working with @entity62 -- he 's actually an actor . he was in " @entity63 , " " @entity67 , " and most recently he was in the @entity65 animation , " @entity66 . " that 's what he 's more known for but his first passion is music . he 's an incredible producer , writer and singer . i just felt like he was always the missing piece . he brought everything together . @entity0 : so now that you 've found your " missing piece , " how would you describe your sound ? @entity6 : our music before was experimenting with afrobeat sounds but now it 's more of a fusion ( of what ) we are inspired by . it 's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic @entity31 percussion . it 's a fusion of everything . @entity0 : and do you guys write the songs as well ? @entity6 : the entire album was pretty much ( written and produced ) by me , my sister and @entity62 . and when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done . @entity100 is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing . @entity0 : what are you listening to right now ? @entity6 : oh my @entity107 , there 's so many ! @entity36 : @entity109 with " chandelier . " @entity6 : i really love this new song -- i do n't know if @entity36 is going to agree with me -- but his name 's @entity113 , it 's called @entity115 ; i love it . @entity0 : as well as your music , you both work with the @entity119 high commissioner for refugees ( @entity119 ) -- how did you start your humanitarian work ? @entity36 : ever since we were kids we wanted to help @entity12 , we always talked about it . but we were like " what can we physically do ? " we were doing some research and we called our mom and she said ' you know you still have family over there . there 's a refugee camp in @entity133 and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp . ' and we did some research about @entity140 refugee camp , it 's a massive camp that has taken in @entity142 refugees , @entity12 refugees , @entity143 refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict . everybody fled to @entity140 . in the beginning ( it was ) pure advocacy talking about it on @entity151 and @entity152 . @entity0 : but then you decided to " up your game " as it were ... @entity36 : yes , then we started a non-profit and we 'd do small benefit concerts in @entity159 and in @entity161 -- wherever there was a big @entity12 community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing , working with @entity119 in a capacity as a spokesperson . we headlined @entity167 at the @entity168 , as well as the @entity169 twice in @entity170 . we felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets , the more we can do . @entity6 : we obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we 've been making these bracelets and necklaces called " @entity178 . " wish stands for " @entity180 . " we wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in @entity133 or @entity12 with women providing them with a sustainable income . @entity0 : so what 's next for you two ? @entity6 : we 're actually in the mixing process right now . we still have a few ( tracks ) to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done . we want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop . @entity36 : i do n't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we 're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for @entity12 . i feel like now because we followed our dreams it 's like ' they 're not just refugees anymore . ' we do n't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to @entity12 and help rebuild -- it 's such a beautiful dream but not ours . in our culture , anything creative is not really respected or appreciated . but i feel like now but even with our new deal we 're still trucking along . i feel like we inspire people . read this : @entity212 soul singer @entity211 is back ! read this : @entity214 takes no prisoners more from @entity31 voices

@entity12 sisters , @entity36 and @placeholder , make up @entity5
