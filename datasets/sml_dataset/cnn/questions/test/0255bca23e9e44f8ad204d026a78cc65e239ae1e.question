( @entity1 ) eyewitness video showing white @entity4 police officer @entity3 shooting to death an unarmed black man has exposed discrepancies in the reports of the first officers on the scene . @entity3 has been fired and charged with murder in the death of 50 - year - old @entity13 . a bystander 's cell phone video , which began after an alleged struggle on the ground between @entity3 and @entity13 , shows the five - year police veteran shooting at @entity13 eight times as @entity13 runs away . @entity13 was hit five times . if words were exchanged between the men , they 're are not audible on the tape . it 's unclear what happened before @entity13 ran , or why he ran . the officer initially said that he used a taser on @entity13 , who , @entity3 said , tried to take the weapon . before @entity3 opens fire , the video shows a dark object falling behind @entity13 and hitting the ground . it 's unclear whether that is the @entity29 . later in the video , when @entity3 approaches @entity13 's body , @entity3 appears to drop a dark object near @entity13 . @entity3 is seen in the video handcuffing @entity13 after the shooting . witness : i nearly erased shooting video out of fear @entity46 , the witness who recorded the video , said he did n't see @entity13 grab @entity29 . his account contradicts what @entity3 told dispatchers . in two interviews with @entity52 , @entity46 said that he was walking to his job in @entity4 on saturday morning when he saw @entity54 , who had been pulled over for a broken taillight . @entity46 told @entity52 's @entity56 on wednesday that he saw the two men struggling on the ground . " they were down on the ( ground ) ... before i started recording , " @entity46 said . " i remember the police ( officer ) had control of the situation . he had control of @entity13 . " @entity46 said he heard the sound of a taser being used . he believed @entity13 was trying to get away from it . but @entity13 never got the @entity29 or used it on the officer , @entity46 told @entity52 . who was @entity13 ? a @entity73 report included brief statements from eight police officers , but not @entity3 . one officer , identified as sgt. @entity77 , said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- @entity3 say he was " in foot pursuit " of another motorist . @entity77 said that while driving to the officer 's location , " @entity3 advised that he deployed his taser and ( requested ) back up units . " seconds later , @entity77 reported , he heard @entity3 tell a dispatcher , " shots fired and the subject is down . he took my @entity29 . " hours after the shooting , @entity90 of @entity91 quoted a statement from police spokesman @entity94 , who said @entity3 attempted to use his taser to stop a fleeing suspect . the men struggled over the device , with the suspect taking the @entity29 and attempting to use it against @entity3 , the newspaper reported . in the police report , another officer , @entity100 , said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call . @entity3 asked him to " secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop . " @entity100 said he spoke to a passenger in the car @entity13 was driving . " the passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle , " the officer reported . the passenger 's identity was not given in the report , but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained . @entity121 spokesman @entity120 confirmed to @entity1 that a man was with @entity13 and said he is not related to the family . the family declined to provide any more information . a timeline of events the @entity128 is not providing additional information , citing an ongoing investigation of @entity13 's killing by the independent @entity132 . @entity77 said when he arrived at the shooting scene , an officer identified only as @entity135 " was administering first aid " to @entity13 . " i exited my vehicle and assisted officer @entity135 with first aid and cpr to the driver , " @entity77 said in the report . " we continued to perform first aid and cpr until @entity144 arrived ... when @entity144 and first responders arrived , @entity144 took care over providing care to the driver , who was pronounced deceased a short time later . " @entity135 , in his account , did not mention performing cpr . " i attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and ( directing ) the best route for @entity144 and fire to get to the victim faster , " he said in the report . an officer identified as sgt. @entity160 said that he requested an ambulance . @entity160 said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw @entity135 " administering chest compression to the defendant . " @entity4 police chief @entity164 was asked at a news conference this week whether @entity140 was performed on @entity13 . " i do not know . i was told that life - saving ... that they tried to save his life , " @entity164 said . @entity4 mayor @entity169 added that not every @entity4 police officer is cpr certified . what we know about officer @entity3
