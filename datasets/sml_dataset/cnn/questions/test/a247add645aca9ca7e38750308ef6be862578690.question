( @entity0 ) well , the thought experiments are finally over . @entity3 's online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be . and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy , certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign . should she win , @entity14 will add to her potential " firsts " : first woman president ; the first president who had been a first lady . there 's another one , too : the first secretary of state to become president since @entity23 . only a handful of the nation 's top diplomats have gone to the @entity27 ( @entity28 ; @entity29 ; @entity30 ; @entity31 ; @entity33 @entity32 ; and @entity23 ) . and none in the 20th century , a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals . too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire , ambition and temperament to compete for the top job . still , on balance , @entity14 's tenure at the @entity49 should be a real advantage during the campaign , particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective @entity56 rivals . but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side . @entity14 will have to negotiate and traverse several tricky and rocky paths to ensure that her @entity49 career remains an advantage and does n't turn into a liability . here 's why : the last president to serve in a top job in the administration of his immediate predecessor was @entity71 . circumstances were different then . far from wanting to distance himself from @entity74 , @entity71 41 saw merit in reinforcing the association with a president who dominated his day in a way few chief executives have . @entity14 will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in @entity85 's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the @entity89 and with @entity90 , than when president @entity85 took office . in the process , she 'll have to define her own approach to the world . indeed , given the president 's vulnerabilities on foreign policy , she ca n't afford to be seen as @entity85 's third term . in her memoir " @entity105 , " she 's already laid the foundation for distancing herself from @entity85 on issues such as doing more for the @entity103 opposition and being tougher on @entity90 's @entity104 . and she can legitimately work to sharpen those differences without seeming to walk away from policies she supported and leaving herself open to charges that she has no principles , only politically expedient tactics . too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her . but so will flip - flopping . nowhere will her challenges be greater than on @entity116 . @entity14 presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the november 2013 interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the @entity121 and @entity116 earlier this month in @entity122 , @entity123 . and she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced @entity116 to the table . the problem , of course , is that her @entity56 opponents and more than a few @entity130 hate what the negotiations have produced . much less enamored with the @entity85 's " let 's engage our enemies " trope , @entity14 may have doubts herself . the good news is that there wo n't be an agreement for months . so for now , she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse , should the @entity116 cheat . but sooner or later , perhaps as early as june if there 's an agreement , @entity14 will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what @entity151 ' role should be . her opponents , the @entity153 , and much of the organized @entity155 community , will portray it as even worse , and that is likely to be somewhat problematic and will be hyped as even worse . and this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the @entity155 community . frankly given her political interests , it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough @entity169 message , hammering the mullahs ' repressive policies at home and their mischief - making in the region . she may not be that lucky . still she will have an advantage in dealing with the @entity178 community . unlike president @entity85 , the @entity179 have strong credentials on the @entity153 issue . and that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with @entity116 that @entity14 launched and its fruits , which are seen by many @entity153 and @entity121 @entity155 right now as too generous to the mullahs . @entity14 's time at the @entity49 should help her in a presidential campaign where @entity121 are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the @entity27 . the @entity56 will try and show that @entity193 and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she did n't accomplish much . @entity14 was n't a @entity199 or a @entity200 . but given the problems she confronted -- @entity116 , stalled @entity153 - @entity204 two - state negotiations ( none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough ) and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy , she performed ably enough . she improved the nation 's image and pushed 21st century issues such as women 's rights , youth , and the environment . her critics will dismiss all this as a kind of naive planetary humanism . still , four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead @entity121 in a dangerous and turbulent world . and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs , that can only help . @entity14 's biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk - readiness of @entity244 and the risk - aversion of @entity85 . and given the cruel and unforgiving nature of the world @entity121 now inhabits , this will be no easy task .

@entity249 : the former secretary of state has to decide whether she 's going to differ with @placeholder 's handling of foreign policy
