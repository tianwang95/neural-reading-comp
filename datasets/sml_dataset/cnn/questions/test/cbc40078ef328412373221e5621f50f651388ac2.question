( @entity0 ) given that most people could n't tell the difference between a copyright and a trademark , it usually takes something controversial , such as the @entity7 ' refusal to change their name , to get people interested in trademark law . this week , a higher court scrutinized a lesser - known trademark -- when the band @entity13 sought to protect its name . the slants are five @entity19 - @entity18 musicians from @entity20 , @entity21 , who pay homage to the ' 80s on stage -- and homage to their heritage in an ironic way . " we want to take on stereotypes that people have about us , like the slanted eyes , and own them , " @entity29 , the band 's front - man , said . in other words , the group adopted the @entity38 philosophy of repeating an insulting term until it does n't mean anything anymore . to @entity13 , " slant " is n't an insult , it is empowering . and more power to them . unfortunately , a bureaucrat at the @entity46 decided that " slant " was disparaging to @entity47 , and denied them a trademark registration under the despised ( by me , anyhow ) section 2 ( a ) of the trademark act . this is the section that lets the government deny trademark protection to a mark that is " immoral , " " scandalous " or " disparaging . " in this case , the latter . but wait a minute . this is n't billionaire @entity61 referring to other people as " @entity7 . " in @entity64 , it is the disparaged group , @entity65 , who are complaining -- not the government deciding on its own that it knows best . in the @entity13 ' case , these are @entity19 guys who say " it does n't bother us , so why should it bother you ? " and it is n't as if any @entity19 groups got involved . this is not the first time that someone has " taken back " a marginalizing term in a trademark fight . about 10 years ago , the motorcycle club " @entity79 " was similarly rebuffed , and they fought back and won the right to protect their mark . they made similar arguments that resonated : if they wanted to call themselves " @entity79 , " then what place does the government have in judging that decision ? in another decision , the trademark office initially denied a registration for @entity91 on the grounds that @entity93 would find it disparaging . but on reconsideration , the @entity94 held that it should go forward stating it is " imperative that the board be careful to avoid interposing its own judgment for that of @entity93 . " so why are n't the @entity98 given the same privileges as @entity100 on bikes or @entity91 ? it is largely a sign of the times . we find ourselves mired deeper and deeper in a society where people actually get excited to take offense at virtually anything . given the lingering controversy over the @entity7 ' trademark , our five friends from @entity21 did n't stand a chance . this decision offends me . for starters , by trying to protect @entity47 from racism , the court issued a disturbingly racist decision based on the fact that these were , in fact , @entity47 who intended their band name to invoke their ethnicity . but , if a @entity125 ( like me ) were to seek to register the same exact name , with no such intent , i would enjoy that privilege . this is n't quite @entity130 ( the decision that authorized putting @entity47 in internment camps ) , but the decision is quite unprincipled . even worse , this decision gets the @entity136 wrong . the majority opinion almost flippantly discards the constitutional issues as much ado about nothing . essentially it says , " we did it this way before , so we are going to keep doing it this way . " your @entity147 got stepped on before , and who are we to take our feet off of it ? if you 're not upset by now , you should be . well , the court does give us a sort - of dissent styled as " additional views . " while not binding , some of our most cherished first amendment rights grew from the tiny seeds planted by the dissents of @entity160 . the dissent in this case recognizes the fact that trademarks are commercial speech , which is protected by the @entity136 . it also notes that the government should not be in the business of giving out or withholding benefits on the basis of the content of the recipient 's speech . this is known as the doctrine of " unconstitutional conditions . " since @entity178 ( a ) discriminates against @entity136 protected expression on the basis of its content , the court has called for 2 ( a ) to be , finally , deemed unconstitutional . but , for some reason , it declined to actually go that far . it merely suggested it , without so ruling . and people wonder why my hair is falling out . i guess i will start a protest band and call them " the @entity191 . " but , i wo n't be allowed to register that trademark -- although the five @entity19 guys from @entity13 could . maybe we should just each register the other band 's marks , and trade them after we get past the bureaucrats at the trademark office .

he says court is wrong : trademarks are commercial speech , protected by @placeholder . ruling a sign or our easily offended times
