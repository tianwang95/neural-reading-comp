( @entity1 ) @entity0 has a tough stance on drug smugglers , and since assuming office in october , president @entity4 has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes . that tough stance casts a further pall on two @entity13 drug smugglers , part of the so - called " @entity15 . " they are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an @entity0 court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from @entity23 on monday . april marks a decade on death row for @entity25 and @entity26 for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot . the 31 - year - old @entity25 has been called the ringleader and 33 - year - old @entity26 has been described as his collaborator . the seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs . the members of the @entity15 were arrested after @entity0 police received a tip from @entity40 . four members of the group were caught at @entity43 with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies . four others , including @entity26 , were arrested at a hotel in the village of @entity49 . although he was n't carrying any drugs , @entity25 was detained after boarding a plane to @entity52 . he was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot . while the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years , the other seven members of the @entity15 have rarely been in the spotlight . here 's a quick look at the other members of the group : @entity63 @entity0 prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the @entity15 , who were identified as drug couriers in the operation . that includes @entity63 of @entity72 , @entity13 . @entity63 was 19 when he was captured in @entity0 . he was arrested at @entity43 with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body . @entity75 life in prison was the original sentence for 29 - year - old @entity75 , also of @entity72 . nineteen at the time of his arrest , @entity75 is one of five of the @entity15 whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison , then reinstated at life again . during his trial , @entity75 testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to @entity88 . he was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened , as well as his family 's , if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation . @entity93 @entity93 from @entity72 , who is now 31 , was one of four drug couriers in the case . he was found in a hotel room on @entity88 's @entity49 with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia . @entity100 and @entity101 the others are @entity100 , 30 and @entity101 , 28 , both from @entity52 . @entity103 quotes @entity100 as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others , especially his family . @entity101 is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home , " do n't judge me too harshly . " he says he has two sisters including a twin . @entity103 is run by @entity113 , a nonprofit organization based in @entity114 . @entity115 and @entity116 the same website details information about @entity119 , now 39 , and the only woman in the @entity15 , 37 - year - old @entity121 . @entity119 was a former bartender from @entity122 , a suburb of @entity123 in @entity124 . he claims he was forced to travel to @entity88 and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family . @entity129 , from @entity130 in @entity124 , @entity13 , was arrested with heroin strapped to her body . she claims @entity25 threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme . during her court appeal , @entity129 apologized to @entity0 for her actions . her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years . during a court appearance in 2006 , @entity25 denied threatening anyone . he told the @entity143 before his sentencing in february of that year : " a lot of lies have been said against me , but the true reality is i 'm not what people put me out to be . i 've never threatened anybody in my life . " the @entity143 also dismissed claims that @entity25 made threats against @entity129 and @entity154 when the two were sentenced in 2006 . @entity13 has repeatedly called for clemency for @entity25 and @entity26 . foreign minister @entity157 said monday , " the government is disappointed at today 's decision by the @entity160 of @entity161 to reject the appeals of @entity25 and @entity26 . we understand that the legal team for mr. @entity25 and mr. @entity26 is considering other legal options . " in a news release posted to the @entity13 government 's website , @entity157 cited the " extensive rehabilitation " both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while @entity13 continues to " use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution .
