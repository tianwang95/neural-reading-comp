( @entity1 ) @entity0 hit rock bottom while wrapped in a dirty blanket on the floor of a jail infirmary bathroom in @entity6 , @entity7 . he was 25 , shivering , sweating , throwing up and going through the full withdrawals of heroin . he had just robbed a bank after shooting up heroin all day . that was july 22 , 2007 , the day his life changed forever . it was the last time he used drugs , the first and only time he was arrested , and the first and only time to fully withdrawal from heroin . " i knew that my whole world was over , and i thought i was going to die because i never had been so sick , " @entity0 said . " i had nothing to my name , and i did n't know if anyone else in the world even knew i was there . " nearly eight years later , @entity0 looks back on his drug - using days like it was another person 's life . @entity0 was your average student in high school playing on the hockey team , occasionally drinking and smoking weed until he began using drugs on a daily basis . he ca n't pinpoint exactly when it started or how or why , but it got to the point where he was smoking marijuana before , during and after school , and experimenting with mushrooms and acid . " anything else that i saw , i would have tried , " he says now . his grades dropped , he lost his eligibility to play sports , but when he was drunk or high , none of that mattered . " i did n't have to worry about what anyone thought , i could just go to a fantasy land and not have worries , " @entity0 said . after graduating from high school in 2000 , @entity0 began abusing @entity54 and @entity55 , opium - containing painkillers . as his tolerance to the pills built up , he began snorting the drugs to feel the effects faster . then he moved on to snorting heroin . " i was n't getting the strong effects of @entity55 anymore , and i was already sniffing something else , so it did n't seem like a leap , " he said . " it did n't seem like the heroin i grew up knowing about . " by 2005 , he had been snorting heroin daily for two years . even as he was doing more and more drugs , he was in denial about his addiction since he had a job with his family 's wholesale snack supply business and a second job as a nightclub bouncer , worked out at the gym and had his own car and a place to live . " on the outside , i had it all , " @entity0 said . that all changed the day he stuck out his arm and had someone put in a needle . once @entity0 started shooting up heroin , his life spiraled downward in only four months . he was hiding from his loved ones and his drug problem was obvious to everyone around him . he still thought he could control his drug use and quit on his own . " i really thought i could stop the next day , but i always had an excuse , " @entity0 said . " i was closed off from the rest of the world . ... i was n't even a part of it anymore . " by july 2007 , he had no more money to fuel his addiction . out of " pure desperation , " he robbed a bank in @entity100 , @entity7 , with another addict . " robbing a bank seemed like a way to get a lot of money fast , which equaled a lot of heroin , " said @entity0 . " that would hold me over for a long time ... i thought . " as @entity0 describes it , his partner entered the bank and handed the teller a cell phone . @entity0 was on the other end , claiming to have a hostage . the men left with the money and were caught after a brief chase . " getting caught never even crossed my mind , " he said . " i was instead planning what i was going to do after : get drugs . " that was the last day he ever used . @entity0 spent the next couple of weeks curled up on the floor of a jail cell withdrawing , cold turkey , from his years of heroin abuse . he describes the withdrawals as like " having food poisoning for three days straight , " combined with a burning , tingling sensation in his bones . " i would flex and punch the floor to try to make it go away . i could n't stop it , and i could n't sit still , " he said . " boiling hot showers were the only thing that felt better . burning , burning , burning . " he was convicted of larceny , conspiracy and threatening to steal from a depository for his part in the robbery . he spent a year in court - ordered rehab and another 22 months in jail . " @entity148 was the catapult for me , " @entity0 said . " it finally made me say , ' it 's over . ' " once released in 2010 , @entity0 vowed to never let drugs influence his life again . he will be celebrating eight years sober this july and has made tremendous strides to repair his life . he is working full time as a salesman for his family 's business and is attending school to become a substance abuse counselor . he is married with a 1 - year - old daughter . and he completed probation last month . " i live a life of honesty and integrity , even when no one is looking , " @entity0 said . " i have a daughter who adores me and thinks i am her hero . and i can be , now . " it 's been a long journey . he spent nearly eight years rebuilding his relationships with his family , paying off debts , fixing his bad credit and rebuilding his reputation in his small town of @entity175 . he wants others to know him as the hardworking family man he is now and not judge him by his past . he acknowledges that it 's always going to be an uphill battle for others to not to have a preconceived image of him . " many people only know about my robbery , addiction and jail time , " he said . " they have no idea about who or what i am now . " @entity0 says he hopes " the ripple effects of being true to myself will eventually drown out the bad . " he already sees that happening when he googles his name and the robbery is no longer the first story that comes up . he visits high school groups to help encourage students to not fall down the path he took and to encourage others to get help . " @entity0 was a great kid growing up , but he lost his way , " said @entity199 , executive director of @entity200 . @entity199 has known @entity0 since he was in middle school , and tried to help him in high school . " he is a perfect example that addiction does n't mean the @entity206 . " to those trying to recover from drugs , @entity0 offers two pieces of advice : 1 . tell everybody . " a lot of families and individuals tend to think or say , ' do n't tell anyone , ' or ' no one has to know . ' the first step in recovery is honesty . when you hide any part of your mistakes or indiscretions , you are blocking yourself from being free from it . " 2 . surround yourself with people who make you want to be a better person . " if you hang out in a barber shop long enough , you 're gon na get a haircut . you have to honestly re-evaluate who you spend time with and remove people who are still using and making other bad choices . " @entity0 has many new goals in life . one is to be an example of what recovery looks like and how an addict can truly change . the bottom line , he says : recovery and long - term sobriety is possible .
