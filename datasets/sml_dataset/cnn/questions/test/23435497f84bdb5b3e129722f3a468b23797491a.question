@entity1 ( @entity2 ) as the @entity3 prepared to deploy to help quell riots in @entity5 , @entity6 , that raged sporadically last year , the guard used highly militarized words such as " enemy forces " and " adversaries " to refer to protesters , according to documents obtained by @entity2 . the guard came to @entity5 to support law enforcement officers , whom many community leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from august through the end of the year . the @entity3 's language , contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a @entity24 request , is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers ' actions in putting down riots . they broke out after the august 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager @entity31 by city police officer @entity32 . a grand jury declined to indict @entity32 in the case . " it 's disturbing when you have what amounts to @entity41 soldiers viewing @entity41 citizens somehow as the enemy , " said @entity35 , an alderman in @entity36 . the documents obtained by @entity2 also detail that the @entity3 was concerned about perceptions of its deployment , with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters . and the communications show them calibrating the timing of their deployment in november -- in anticipation of the @entity57 grand jury 's decision on whether to indict @entity32 -- to try to ensure that their presence did n't further dial up tensions , though several community members voiced concern that they were not deployed quickly enough . " we are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize backlash from calling up the @entity3 early , " col. @entity63 , @entity64 chief of staff at the @entity3 , informed his officers in a nov. 18 email . " we have coordinated for lower profile , less confrontation likely mission sets to emphasize support roles and minimize public militarization perception . " additionally , some in the @entity3 seemed worried the language in the mission briefings could be problematic . days before the announcement of the grand jury 's decision , an email from @entity63 warned of potential consequences from using language that could be " construed as potentially inflammatory . " two days after that , notification was sent to commanding officers stating that " all reference of ' enemy ' were changed to state ' criminal elements ' . " still , @entity91 spokesman capt. @entity91 defended the militarized language as standard for the planning process ahead of deployment . in an email to @entity2 , he said the documents used in the @entity5 mission briefings were " a generic military planning format utilized in a wide range of military missions , so the term ' enemy forces ' would be better understood as ' potential threats . ' often in guard operations , threats would include inclement weather , heat , failing levees , etc. " in further comments emailed to @entity2 late friday , after the initial version of this article appeared , @entity91 insisted that " while the term ' enemy forces ' appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language , they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission " and claimed that the language was changed " well ahead of the grand jury 's decision . " but internal communications from as early as aug. 14 through nov. 18 , when the directive was issued to change the inflammatory language , show numerous uses of the terms that were sent to a large number of @entity91 commanders and leadership . though the @entity3 's actions throughout the fall did not elicit the type of complaints that were directed at the police , some in @entity5 were displeased that the guardsman did n't do more to act against looters and vandals . @entity5 mayor @entity142 criticized the guard at a november 25 news conference , saying that " unfortunately , as the unrest grew and further assistance was needed , the @entity3 was not deployed in enough time to save all our businesses . " @entity91 , in his comments to @entity2 , responded that it would not have been part of the @entity3 's mission to confront those destroying businesses . rather , the force would have stood guard at sites of unrest while law enforcement officers entered looted businesses and arrested suspects . the documents reveal that the @entity6 guard was especially concerned that " adversaries " might use phone apps and police scanners to expose operational security . " counterintelligence operations are directed at supporting an information campaign . their audience does not require the information to be accurate and is easily swayed , " one document read . a document titled " @entity177 , " which outlines the @entity3 's mission in @entity5 , listed players on the ground deemed " @entity179 " and " @entity180 . " among groups characterized as hate groups were the @entity183 , the @entity184 and the @entity185 , but also " @entity186 . " the document read : " protesters have historically used @entity189 cocktails , rocks , and other debris to throw at police . several small arms fire incidents have occurred . some elements may utilize militants [ sic ] tactics taught by @entity197 . " a communication specifying the types of gear and dangers the soldiers were likely to face warned that , " rioters likely have constructed home - made protection like goggles , gas masks , and plywood shields . further , select individuals may have bullet proof vests and may carry firearms . " it further noted that , " a possible method of attack is the use of @entity216 against personnel and equipment . also the possibility exists of the use of arson for destruction and disruption of the power grid through targeted attack . " in addition to analyzing the threat general protesters could pose to soldiers , the @entity3 also briefed its commanders on their intelligence capabilities so they could " deny adversaries the ability to identify @entity3 vulnerabilities upon which threat forces may exploit , causing embarrassment , or harm to the @entity238 , " the mission set states . " adversaries are most likely to possess human intelligence ( @entity244 ) , open source intelligence ( @entity246 ) , signals intelligence ( @entity248 ) , technical intelligence ( @entity250 ) , and counterintelligence capabilities , " states @entity240 3 , which outlines @entity241 . but the ways the @entity3 lists for how this information can be obtained are nothing more than open records , social media , and listening on conversations being carries out in public by civil authorities or law enforcement . " overseas deployments are all about predictability , " col. @entity63 of the @entity3 warned in an email on august 25 in the wake of protests just two weeks after the death of @entity31 . " @entity267 ( defense in support of civil authorities ) is not , it is all about rapid expansion and contraction to fit quickly shifting support requirements . " correction : an earlier version of this story misstated details about the @entity57 grand jury 's decision on whether to indict @entity32 .

the @placeholder 's language worries those who objected to the tactics used in quelling riots
