( @entity0 ) remember the @entity1 from the 1930s ? scientists studied poor african - americans in @entity5 who 'd contracted the venereal disease but did n't tell them they had the disease or do anything to cure them . a lawsuit filed this week alleges @entity13 and the @entity14 helped conduct a similar study in @entity16 from 1945 to 1956 . orphans , inmates , psychiatric patients and prostitutes were deliberately infected with sexually transmitted diseases to determine what drugs , including penicillin , worked best in stopping the diseases , the lawsuit says . the subjects of the experiments were n't told they 'd been infected , the lawsuit says , causing some to die and others to pass the disease to their spouses , sexual partners and children . the suit seeks more than $ 1 billion in damages and has 774 plaintiffs , including people who were subjects in the experiments and their descendants . this is the second attempt to collect damages . in 2012 , a class - action federal lawsuit was filed against the @entity45 government over the @entity16 experiments conducted by the @entity47 . a judge dismissed it , saying the @entity16 could not sue the @entity45 for grievances that happened overseas . the new lawsuit was filed in the @entity52 . @entity13 and the @entity14 filed statements on their websites condemning the experiments , but denying responsibility . " the plaintiffs ' essential claim in this case is that prominent @entity13 faculty members ' participation on a government committee that reviewed funding applications was tantamount to conducting the research itself and that therefore @entity13 should be held liable , " the @entity13 statement said . " neither assertion is true . " the lawsuit alleges the @entity14 funded @entity13 ' research into public health issues , including venereal disease , and employed scientists who monitored the @entity16 experiments . the lawsuit , the @entity14 statement said , " seeks improperly to assign ' guilt by association ' in the absence of compensation from the @entity45 federal government . " the suit says @entity13 and the @entity14 designed , supported and benefited from the @entity16 experiments . @entity83 pharmaceutical group and that company 's owner , @entity86 , also are defendants . the pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments , the suit says . on saturday , a spokeswoman for @entity83 sent this statement to @entity0 : " we 've only just received the complaint in this matter . @entity83 played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease . as a company dedicated to patients , we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations . " nobody doubts the experiments happened . in 2010 , then - secretary of state @entity109 apologized to @entity16 for the experiments , saying they were " clearly unethical . " in the 1930s and 1940s , the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors , the suit says . the lawsuit says @entity13 controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease . the lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects . a woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes , the suit says . the lawsuit does n't say why the experiments ended . the results were never published and were not revealed until 2011 , when the @entity139 wrote a letter to president @entity141 telling of its investigation , the suit says . @entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this report .

a similar lawsuit filed against the @placeholder government was dismissed
