( @entity5 ) a 110 - day cat - and - mouse chase spanning from @entity2 waters to the coast of @entity4 had an unlikely end when the crew of an alleged poaching vessel were rescued by conservationists pursuing them . environmentalist group @entity10 had been tailing the @entity11 -- subject of an @entity14 " purple notice " for suspected fraud and fisheries - related crimes -- since its ship the @entity18 encountered it in the @entity20 several months ago . the pursuit ended early monday in the @entity22 , off the coast of @entity4 , when the @entity18 received a distress call from the @entity11 . " we were literally a few hundred meters away ; they said the ship was sinking and they were abandoning the @entity11 , " said @entity10 spokesman @entity24 . " we invited the crew -- 40 of them -- on board , had a medical officer check them over , provided them with food and water . " @entity18 captain @entity10 said the crew rescued from the ship had been handed over to the @entity37 coastguard early tuesday . he said he hoped the authorities would work with @entity14 to prosecute those operating the vessel . " we obviously want to see the captain of the thunder prosecuted for his offenses , " he told @entity5 by phone from the @entity18 , at sea to the west of @entity37 . @entity48 said he believed the @entity11 was deliberately sunk to destroy physical evidence of illegal fishing . " i 'm 100 % confident that the captain of the @entity11 destroyed his own ship , " he said . @entity48 said he had managed to send three crew members aboard the abandoned thunder before it went down . " usually what happens when a vessel is sinking is the master will ensure all compartments and hatches are shut so as to maintain buoyancy , " he said . " on the @entity11 , all the hatches had been opened , including the hatch leading to the fish hold . " he said his crew had retrieved computers , mobile phones and other devices from the thunder that would be handed over to assist any investigation . they had also retrieved a fish from the ship 's fish hold , which he said was about a quarter full . he said the fish was a toothfish , the prized stock his organization claims the @entity11 was illegally catching when they were encountered in the @entity20 . more surprising was the reaction of the captain of the @entity11 as his ship went under , he claimed . " when the vessel went completely under the water , the captain of the @entity11 , who was in a life raft at the time , started cheering and applauding , which was very unusual behavior for a skipper who had just lost his ship , " he said . the pursuit of the @entity11 began after the @entity18 encountered the vessel off the coast of @entity2 , said @entity24 . he claimed the vessel was found with its nets in the water , illegally catching @entity90 toothfish . the @entity11 dropped its nets and left the scene ; a second @entity10 vessel that was brought in to retrieve the net found about $ 3 million of toothfish catch in about 72km of illegal gillnet , he claimed . " that 's why they 're out there in these shadowlands , these unpatrolled remote regions , " he said . meanwhile the @entity18 , supported by a second @entity10 vessel , pursued the @entity11 all the way to the @entity22 . during that time , @entity24 claimed , the @entity18 narrowly avoided being rammed by the fishing vessel , while its smaller boats were struck with grappling hooks . the rescue had gone smoothly despite the months of tensions between the two vessels , said @entity24 . " we worried what they might be like to our crew , whether they might be hostile or violent to us , " he said . but the @entity116 crew who made up the majority of those on board the @entity11 seemed " very relieved " to be rescued . the officers -- who he believed were @entity122 -- were less so . " perhaps they would have preferred to have been rescued by someone else , but given the location there was really no other option , " he said . an @entity14 " purple notice , " released at the request of @entity139 in december 2013 , put out a global call for information on the @entity11 , as well as information on " the individuals and networks that own , operate and profit from the illegal actions of the vessel . " it said the vessel had changed its name , national registration and other characteristics a number of times to avoid detection of its illegal fishing activities , and had sailed under the names " @entity149 " and " @entity150 , " and under the flags of @entity152 and @entity153 . the @entity14 notice said it had " conflicting information " about the identity of the vessel 's current operator , but said it had previously been registered as owned by companies in @entity122 , the @entity156 and @entity152 . @entity14 confirmed tuesday that the purple notice remained in place . it said it had monitored the situation and noted that all the vessel 's crew members were safely ashore . " @entity14 does not conduct investigations itself ; however , we remain available to support any national law enforcement authorities with jurisdiction in this case if such assistance is requested , " it told @entity5 . it said no requests had been received as yet .

the conservationist group had pursued the vessel since it was found illegally fishing off @placeholder , it says
