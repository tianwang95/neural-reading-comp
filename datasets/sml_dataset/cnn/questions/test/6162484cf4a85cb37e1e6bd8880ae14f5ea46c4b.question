( @entity6 ) in a sobering example of life imitating art , the chaos sweeping the streets of @entity2 may have been partly inspired by a series of action - horror movies . @entity2 police said rioting at a shopping mall and elsewhere monday afternoon started amid rumors , spread on social media , of a " purge " led by large groups of marauding high school students . the term appears to be a reference to 2013 's " @entity19 " and its sequel , last year 's " the purge : anarchy , " about a dystopian future @entity22 where on one day each year , all laws are suspended for a 12 - hour period and all crimes , including murder , become temporarily legal . in the movies , set in @entity28 , people barricade themselves in their homes at night while gangs of violent " purgers " roam the streets . the government markets the sanctioned mayhem as a catharsis that reduces crime on the other 364 days of the year -- when in fact it 's really a means of population control , mostly against people living in poor urban neighborhoods . both " purge " movies were box - office hits and a third installment , " @entity19 : vengeance , " is planned for 2016 . the @entity47 reported that a flier circulated widely among city school students via social media touted a " purge " to begin monday at 3 p.m. at @entity51 and end downtown . the flier included an image of protesters smashing the windshield of a police car in @entity2 on saturday , the @entity47 said . how @entity2 police , protesters battle on twitter @entity61 's largest city has been on edge since an @entity64 man , @entity63 , died april 19 from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody . peaceful protests gave way to violence saturday night and again monday , as agitators threw bricks at police , looted stores and set fire to cars and buildings . scattered references to # purge and # @entity78 began appearing in @entity59 and @entity80 posts monday about the unrest in @entity2 .

some of @placeholder 's unrest may have been inspired by the " purge " movies
