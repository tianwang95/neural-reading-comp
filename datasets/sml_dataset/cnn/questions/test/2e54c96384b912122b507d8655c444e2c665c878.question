( @entity1 ) it would have made @entity2 proud . established on the birthday of the @entity5 founding father , @entity6 -- the world 's newest micronation -- is founded on a firm belief in liberty and noninterference from the powers - that - be . a tiny , 7 square - kilometer parcel of land , marked on maps as @entity18 , its territory abuts the @entity19 on the border between @entity21 and @entity22 . the victim of a border dispute between @entity21 and @entity22 , it is claimed by neither side -- effectively a no - man 's land . no one lives on this patch of land , which is heavily forested and contains only badly - maintained access roads and a run - down house , abandoned for decades . this is where euroskeptic @entity34 politician @entity33 stepped in . on april 13 he planted his newly - designed yellow and black flag in the territory , declaring the area the @entity40 of @entity6 -- a tiny sliver of a country , bigger only than the @entity43 and @entity44 . he tells @entity1 that the country will be formally founded on may 1 and is inviting , through the media , the world 's heads of state to attend a formal ceremony marking the presumptive nation 's birth . he says that he will also invite 7,500 of the 300,000 applicants that applied to become citizens of @entity6 to the ceremony , where he will grant them citizenship . " i will grant citizenship if they can make it to the party , " he told @entity1 by phone . " it 's short notice but a good challenge , and also for the presidents ( and other heads of state ) if they can make it to the founding of our country . " @entity33 , an active member of the @entity34 's @entity69 , opposes excessive government interference . he says his attempts to enact change in his home country led him to the political experiment that is @entity6 . " i would describe it as a global revolution . it 's just the beginning , " he tells @entity1 via @entity77 . founded on staunchly libertarian principles -- its motto is " to live and let live " -- its website describes its system of governance as being a " constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy . " it will use a form of cryptocurrency -- similar to @entity90 -- as its national currency , bypassing the need for a central bank and will , according to its constitution , keep government 's noses out of everything possible , from the banks to prostitution . " @entity101 prides itself on personal and economic freedom of its people , which is guaranteed by the @entity105 , which significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the @entity6 nation , " the world 's newest constitutional document states . financial regulation will be minimal , if at all present . @entity33 says almost 300,000 applications for citizenship have been received , about 20 of which have been accepted . " thousands of @entity5 , @entity117 people . also a lot of @entity120 peoples who feel oppressed by the regimes there . " he envisions , ultimately , a community of around 35,000 @entity125 , not all of whom will be full - time residents . he says he expects trouble from his neighbors , whose land he has effectively annexed . " from @entity21 , @entity22 , we expect some trouble but we expect international laws will applied and any movement against us would be an attack on a sovereign nation , and we will offer nothing but passive resistance . for now , ( though ) we will make roads , docks . " for its part , the @entity21 @entity141 released a statement to @entity1 that stated that @entity101 would not theoretically impinge upon its border , which is delineated by the @entity19 , but " the @entity141 also considers this a frivolous act which needs no further comment . " @entity22 's counterpart was similarly dismissive . " virtual quips , however interesting they occasionally sound , remain what they are -- virtual quips , and for them we have no official comment . "
