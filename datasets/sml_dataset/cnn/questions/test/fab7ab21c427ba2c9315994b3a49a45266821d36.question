( @entity0 ) the @entity1 officially became the 123rd member of the @entity3 on wednesday , a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in @entity1 territories . the formal accession was marked with a ceremony at @entity10 , in the @entity11 , where the court is based . the @entity13 signed the @entity3 's founding @entity14 in january , when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed " in the occupied @entity1 territory , including @entity18 , since june 13 , 2014 . " later that month , the @entity3 opened a preliminary examination into the situation in @entity1 territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against @entity23 . as members of the court , @entity13 may be subject to counter-charges as well . @entity23 and the @entity29 , neither of which is an @entity3 member , opposed the @entity13 ' efforts to join the body . but @entity1 foreign minister @entity33 , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . " as @entity39 formally becomes a @entity40 to the @entity14 today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , " he said , according to an @entity3 news release . " indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . " judge @entity49 , a vice president of the @entity3 , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the @entity13 . " as the @entity14 today enters into force for the @entity13 , @entity39 acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a @entity40 to the @entity56 . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , " she said . rights group @entity58 welcomed the development . " governments seeking to penalize @entity39 for joining the @entity3 should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , " said @entity60 , international justice counsel for the group . " what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not @entity39 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . " in january , when the preliminary @entity3 examination was opened , @entity23 prime minister @entity78 described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the @entity29 also said it " strongly " disagreed with the court 's decision . " as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that @entity39 is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the @entity3 , " the @entity85 said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . " we will continue to oppose actions against @entity23 at the @entity3 as counterproductive to the cause of peace , " it said . but the @entity3 begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as " @entity39 . " while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor @entity106 said her office would " conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . " the war between @entity23 and @entity112 militants in @entity114 last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the @entity3 was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . @entity0 's @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .

@entity23 and the @placeholder opposed the move , which could open the door to war crimes investigations against @entity23
