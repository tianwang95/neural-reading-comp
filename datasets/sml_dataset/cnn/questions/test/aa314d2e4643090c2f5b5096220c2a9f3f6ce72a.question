( @entity3 ) with help from some filmmakers , 102 - year - old @entity0 went back in time . @entity0 was a dancer in such @entity5 nightspots as the @entity6 and the @entity7 in the 1930s and 1940s , part of chorus lines that entertained alongside notables including @entity12 and @entity13 . there were motion pictures made of @entity0 , but she had never seen any of them . moreover , her photographs and memorabilia had all been lost over the years . so she had never seen herself actually dancing -- until now . @entity19 of jazz - on - film.com and some volunteers put together a video of " soundies " -- early music videos -- and showed them to @entity0 at the nursing home where she lives . the ageless dancer was delighted . " it 's just fabulous , " she said .

thanks to filmmakers , @placeholder -- now 102 -- finally saw herself dance
