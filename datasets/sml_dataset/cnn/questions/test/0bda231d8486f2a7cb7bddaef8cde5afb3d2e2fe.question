( @entity1 ) @entity0 seems to be trying single - handedly this week to make everyone in @entity4 laugh . and she 's off to a good start . the comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet tuesday night at the 2015 time 100 gala in @entity10 -- right in front of fellow honorees @entity13 and @entity14 , who stepped around her as they moved down the line . the stunt drew guffaws from the paparazzi and other onlookers , although @entity13 -- perhaps not used to being upstaged -- looked unamused . " i saw them , and i asked my publicist , ' can i dive in front of them and act like i fell ? ' and she said , ' i ca n't stop you , ' " @entity0 told people . the prank came the same night the third season of @entity0 's hit show , " @entity30 , " premiered on @entity29 . the episode has won praise for its " @entity43 " video , which ridicules mens ' obsession with a certain female body part , and a " @entity42 " parody in which high school football players protest their new coach 's " no raping " policy . and it came the night after @entity0 appeared on @entity46 ' " @entity45 " and turned @entity47 red - faced when she lifted her dress to show him a scar she got from surfing and said , " that 's my vagina . " @entity47 , who had urged her to " do something now that you 'll regret , " turned to the chortling audience and said , " well , i asked for it , did n't i ? " so yes , you can say @entity0 -- who in the past two weeks has graced the cover of @entity56 , hosted the @entity57 and learned her tv show was just renewed for a fourth season -- is having a moment . " they were right there ! the epicenter of @entity4 ( celebrity culture . ) got ta do it , " @entity0 told people about her @entity67 red carpet dive . " it was the best . "
