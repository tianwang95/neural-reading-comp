( @entity2 ) where do you go from here ? the fourth season of " @entity5 " saw massive battles , major deaths ( @entity8 ! ) and @entity9 , but what can fans expect sunday as we head into a fifth season of one of the most popular shows in @entity17 history ? it 's the most high - profile premiere yet , airing simultaneously in 170 countries for the first time . ( @entity17 is a @entity21 company , like @entity2 . ) we sought out " @entity25 " aficionado @entity24 , a writer for @entity26 and a former @entity2 employee , who had a few thoughts on the matter ( beware , tv fans , he has read the books ) . " we 're going to start seeing some of the show 's major story arcs coming together , " @entity24 said ( as confirmed by the executive producers ) . " already , @entity35 has shown up at the @entity36 to save @entity37 and the rest of the @entity39 from the wildlings , " he said . " now we 'll see how his quest for the @entity42 collides with the watch 's supposedly non-political role protecting the realm . " @entity47 's path should cross with @entity48 ' this season , according to the trailers . " season five also will be unique in that some of the major story arcs will clearly be moving ahead of where @entity54 is in the ' @entity57 ' books , " @entity24 pointed out . executive producer @entity58 told @entity59 , " we are starting to build to a crescendo , which means the battles have to get bigger and things have to get more dramatic . " indeed , this fifth season means we 're past the halfway point , with the show currently set to end after seven years . the @entity67 daughters , @entity68 and @entity69 , will be the characters to watch this season , as will @entity72 . the world of @entity74 is constantly plagued by war , but is there a time when people have just had enough ? " wars are waged by the nobles , but it 's the common folk who suffer , " @entity24 noted . " and , this season , we 'll get a glimpse of what happens when those common people have had enough . "

the smash hit series " @placeholder " returns for a fifth season sunday
