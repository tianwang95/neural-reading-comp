( @entity2 ) the @entity0 of the @entity1 was supposed to be all about the symbolic handshake between the @entity4 and @entity5 . but insert @entity6 into the mix and @entity8 , @entity9 , quickly turns into a " triangle of tension . " heads of state from 35 countries in the @entity14 have met every three years to discuss economic , social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994 . @entity5 has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery , with some @entity21 leaders threatening not to attend the @entity22 if the @entity4 and @entity23 did n't agree to invite president @entity24 . the tide changed december 17 , 2014 , when president @entity26 and @entity24 announced that more than five decades of @entity28 rivalry was ending . diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in @entity33 and @entity34 , and the attention immediately focused on the @entity22 , where for the first time since the about - face , @entity26 and @entity24 would come face - to - face . the much anticipated handshake between @entity26 and @entity24 would steal all the headlines if it was n't for @entity5 's strongest ally , @entity6 . @entity6 president @entity41 recently accused the @entity4 of trying to topple his government and banned former president @entity43 , former vice president @entity44 , and senators @entity45 and @entity46 from entering @entity6 . " they ca n't enter @entity6 because they 're terrorists , " @entity41 said , blaming the @entity21 politicians for what he called terrorist actions in @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 . the @entity55 said the allegations of @entity4 involvement in a coup plot against @entity41 were " baseless and false . " later , @entity26 issued an executive order sanctioning seven @entity6 officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a " threat to national security . " @entity66 officials said every executive order includes that language , but it has sparked a fiery response from @entity41 , who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order . he also asked for repeal in full - page ads in the @entity76 and in a @entity8 newspaper . @entity41 did n't stop there ; he has been rallying other @entity21 leaders , including @entity81 president @entity80 , @entity83 's @entity82 and @entity85 's @entity84 . but perhaps most damning for the @entity4 -- and creating the " triangle of tension " at the summit -- @entity5 foreign minister @entity89 has sided publicly with @entity41 . " we reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of @entity6 and the continued foreign interference with the purpose of creating a climate of instability in that sister nation . we ratify our firmest support to the @entity100 and the legitimate government headed by president @entity41 , " @entity89 said . while the world watches for the photo - op of @entity26 and @entity24 , it 's unclear if more @entity21 diplomats will side with @entity41 , and for @entity4 , the @entity0 of the @entity1 could go from " @entity106 " to a walk into the lion 's den.

@entity6 president says @placeholder moved to oust him ; he has the support of the @entity5 foreign minister
