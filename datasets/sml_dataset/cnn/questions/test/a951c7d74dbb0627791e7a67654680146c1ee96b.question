( @entity0 ) several of the world 's worst terrorist groups , like @entity3 and @entity4 , aim to create societies governed by strict , distorted versions of @entity8 law . that means anyone who does n't subscribe to such extremist views are enemies and in danger -- @entity14 included . of course , @entity14 are n't the only ones who have suffered at the hands of such organizations . for example , most victims of @entity3 are fellow @entity21 who refuse to go along with the @entity3 worldview and ruthless tactics . still , there 's ample evidence that @entity14 have been targeted . the latest came friday , when an @entity27 prosecutor revealed that a network of @entity29 associated with @entity30 talked about attacking the @entity31 back in march 2010 . " this is ... a reminder about the world we 're in right now , " @entity33 rep. @entity32 , @entity34 , told @entity0 on friday . " ... i do think there 's a larger narrative about @entity42 persecution ( by ) militant groups around the world . " this attack was n't carried out , but many others have been . some acts are not centrally organized but are no less horrific , such as reports that @entity21 migrants threw 12 @entity14 off a boat in the @entity51 . other deadly acts and alleged plots have been blamed on established terror groups , including these recent examples : @entity56 asked for an ambulance to come to his @entity59 home on sunday after ( he claimed ) he accidentally shot himself in the thigh . besides getting medical help , @entity56 was arrested after authorities found four kalashnikov guns , a revolver , ammunition , police armbands and more in his car and residence , @entity59 prosecutor @entity61 said on wednesday . they also turned up " documents in @entity72 mentioning @entity30 and @entity3 " and correspondence with someone in @entity76 " asking him to target a church . " prime minister @entity77 later went to a church in the @entity59 suburb of @entity80 , one of the at least two such @entity42 places of worship that @entity56 allegedly targeted . while he did n't elaborate , @entity61 said that the satellite navigation system in @entity56 's car -- which included a loaded @entity86 and more -- had one church 's location plugged in . it 's not clear what group , if any , @entity56 was working with or possibly getting orders from . still , authorities flatly characterized him as a terrorist -- linking him to the death of 32 - year - old @entity95 , whom @entity61 called the region 's first victim of terrorism since the @entity100 massacre and kosher market siege in january . regardless of whether @entity56 is ever convicted in @entity95 's killing , it appears unlikely that he 'll be able to commit more violence anytime soon . " a terrorist attack has been foiled , " @entity106 president @entity105 said . @entity3 has turned its beheadings of hostages into horror shows , producing propaganda videos seemingly aimed at producing the maximum amount of terror . what set the one from april apart were the number of people killed and that they were @entity14 from @entity117 . @entity117 's government said monday that 30 of its citizens were among two groups of prisoners shown being beheaded in @entity122 in a video released a day earlier , according to the @entity124 . that 39 - minute video shows one set of captives killed on a beach along the @entity51 , while the other group is taken hundreds of miles away , to southern @entity122 . " all praise be to @entity134 , the @entity135 and cherisher of the world and may peace and blessings be upon the @entity139 , " the video 's narrator says in @entity72 . " to the nation of the cross , we are back again on the sands , where the companions of the @entity139 , peace be upon him , have stepped on before , telling you : @entity21 blood that was shed under the hands of your religion is not cheap . " the same video brazenly claims that @entity3 has been merciful to @entity14 in @entity151 -- by giving them the choice of paying a fine if they refuse to convert to @entity154 . but not all have taken this offer , according to a different speaker . " the @entity159 has offered the @entity42 community this many times and set a deadline for this , " this speaker says , using the name @entity3 calls itself . " but the @entity14 never cooperated . " everyone at @entity166 's @entity165 suffered in some way when a handful of @entity4 gunmen stormed the campus early this month . but death was reserved for @entity14 . according to @entity173 , the terrorists separated students by religion -- allowing @entity21 to leave and killing @entity14 . nightmare accounts soon emerged , like that of @entity178 , who told @entity0 that she he hid in her closet when gunmen burst in and called out two of her roommates . " ( the attackers ) told them if you do n't know to read to them in the @entity21 word , ... then you lie down , " recalled @entity178 , who refused to come out for two days . " and then , if you know , you go to the other side . " this tactic of separating non-muslims from @entity21 mirrors what @entity4 attackers did in december at a quarry in the @entity166 village of @entity195 , where at least 36 were killed , according to the @entity166 @entity196 . one of @entity4 's explicit aims is to turn @entity198 , its home base , into a fundamentalist @entity154 state , according to the @entity201 . but that 's not its only apparent goal , as the group has increasingly branched out -- including into neighboring @entity166 , which is 80 % @entity42 -- to inflict pain and terror . after the the @entity166 university attack , which left nearly 150 people dead , @entity210 , @entity211 's regional governor , dismissed @entity4 's claims that it only kills non-muslims as " a tricky way of doing business . " " the fallacy and satanic mindset of @entity4 is that , in @entity198 , they kill @entity21 and @entity198 , " @entity210 said , claiming the group 's militants are " bent on nothing but destruction . ... that is something we need to fight . " two suicide blasts rocked a @entity42 community in the eastern @entity29 city of @entity229 , killing at least 14 people and wounding scores more , according to officials . and that 's just the beginning , pledged the @entity29 @entity235 . one of the blasts left behind panicked residents , twisted metal and shattered glass outside a church compound in the @entity241 of @entity229 , according to video aired by @entity0 affiliate @entity243 . afterward , @entity29 @entity235 spokesman @entity244 claimed responsibility for the carnage and promised more such attacks until @entity8 law is implemented in @entity29 . these blasts recalled one from september 2013 , when 81 people died in a suicide bombing at the @entity253 of @entity254 in @entity255 . two attackers burst into the church filled with about 500 people right as services concluded , blowing themselves up , according to the @entity261 diocese . choir members and children attending sunday school were among the dead . in a subsequent statement , the rev. @entity266 , the bishop of @entity255 , called the attack a " total failure " of official efforts to protect minorities such as @entity14 , who make up less than 3 % of @entity29 's population . sadly , the shock of the mass killings of the @entity117 @entity14 in april may have been dulled simply because of a nearly identical atrocity a few weeks before . @entity3 released a five - minute video in february showing the mass murder of @entity278 from @entity279 . produced by the @entity159 's propaganda wing @entity282 , the video shows black - clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a @entity122 beach . some of the hostages cry out " oh @entity287 " and " oh @entity288 " as they are pushed to the ground , just before they take their final breaths . " the sea you have hidden sheikh @entity296 's body in , we swear to @entity134 , we will mix it with your blood , " a masked man says in @entity300 before the beheadings . news of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 @entity279 @entity14 were kidnapped in two incidents in the @entity122 coastal city of @entity306 . the @entity3 video shows the beheading of around a dozen men , though @entity279 officials say all 21 kidnapped @entity14 were killed . @entity279 's government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in @entity3 ' @entity122 stronghold of @entity317 , according to @entity279 foreign minister @entity318 . " avenging @entity279 blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty , " the @entity279 military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television . modern - day @entity327 are a significant part of human history , tracing their roots back to one of the earliest civilizations . their ancestors were also some of the first people to embrace @entity42 in large numbers . now the @entity327 are battling @entity3 for survival in their native @entity76 and @entity151 . this fight came into focus in february , when the militant group took over villages and took more than 260 @entity327 hostage in northeastern @entity76 , according to @entity342 , the founder of the @entity343 . @entity342 expressed fears then that these @entity327 in @entity76 would meet the same fate as others in neighboring @entity151 . some of the @entity327 hostages taken in february have been released , but the fate of many more remains unknown . even those not in captivity face dire threats , given @entity3 's well - established reputation of offering little to no mercy to @entity14 . the number of @entity14 in @entity151 has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today , according to estimates from @entity357 , the largest @entity42 relief organization in northern @entity151 . @entity3 is n't the only reason for this drop , but it certainly is a big one . the militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in @entity151 as well as @entity76 , with @entity14 among its targets . that includes its taking over @entity151 's largest @entity42 city , the mostly @entity327 community of @entity368 , in august 2014 . @entity3 has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond @entity368 , though , like its capture and control of @entity372 , @entity151 's second - largest city . the group 's advance there prompted @entity42 families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to @entity154 , paying a fine or facing " death by sword . " @entity381 , a @entity382 - @entity33 leader and spokesman for the group @entity384 in @entity151 , claims that @entity151 @entity42 children have been beheaded , mothers raped and fathers killed by @entity3 militants in recent months . " this is truly a living nightmare that 's not going away , " @entity381 told @entity0 . " @entity42 in @entity372 is dead , and a @entity42 holocaust is in our midst . "
