@entity2 , @entity1 ( @entity3 ) the @entity1 government says @entity4 , also known by aliases @entity6 and @entity7 , is the mastermind of thursday 's @entity1 university terror attack , according to a tweet from the country 's @entity11 . @entity13 , an @entity14 - linked militant group based in @entity15 , took responsibility for the attack , according to the @entity18 in @entity19 . @entity20 is " credited with having an extensive terrorist network within @entity1 , " according to a ministry document given to @entity3 . earlier , the ministry posted a " @entity25 " notice for @entity20 . it offers a reward of 20 million @entity1 shillings , which is about $ 215,000 . " we appeal to anyone with any info on # @entity7 to share with relevant authorities and security agencies , " the @entity11 posted on @entity29 . @entity20 is in charge of external operations against @entity1 , the document says , and he is the regional commander within @entity13 in charge of the @entity39 region . in this role , he commands the militia along the border and " is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country . " his network extends within the @entity48 refugee camp , the document says . @entity48 is the world 's biggest refugee camp , home to thousands of people , according to the @entity53 . it 's located in @entity1 's @entity55 near @entity15 . @entity56 : exposing smuggler routes across the @entity15 - @entity1 border @entity20 has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years , including december 's quarry attack , which killed at least 36 people . in that attack , @entity13 militants separated non-muslim workers from their @entity67 counterparts and killed them . @entity20 is @entity1 and has three wives and three siblings , including two with links to @entity13 , the document says . also sunday , @entity1 's @entity11 identified another terrorist involved in the @entity74 attack as @entity75 . @entity75 's father , @entity76 , a government chief in @entity77 in northern @entity1 , told @entity3 that his son was missing . @entity79 is a @entity1 @entity15 , he said . his son graduated in 2013 from @entity81 law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing , @entity76 said in a phone interview . " i have received reports from people who found information ( on ) the internet that my son was one of the terrorists , " @entity76 said . " i previously told the government that the son is missing . i sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son . " he added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared . @entity76 said he had " really given up on him . " on sunday , families of some of the more than 147 people slain at @entity74 left a mortuary in @entity19 , @entity1 , after identifying the bodies of their loved ones . one woman almost had to be carried out . " why ? why ? where are you , my children ? " she wailed . across @entity2 , there was a sense of fear , foreboding and grief . the news agency @entity112 videotaped a man holding his daughter 's hand at a local church , as military patrols and security officials searched people . a church member told the agency , " nowhere is safe , but here in church you can come , you be with @entity125 and then you just console yourself . " horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge . to survive @entity13 militants blazing through her dorm , shooting and killing classmates , 19 - year - old @entity130 went into a closet , covering herself with clothes . her two roommates hid under their beds . the gunmen called them out . " ( the gunmen ) told them if you do n't know to read to them in the @entity67 word , whatever , and then you lie down , " @entity130 told @entity3 . " and then , if you know , you go to the other side . " the teenager did n't see what happened next . she heard it . " they were shooting everywhere , " she said . " i did n't want to open my eyes . " for the next two days , @entity130 did n't budge . unable to get to water , she hydrated by drinking body lotion . when police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done , with 147 dead at the school -- she did n't believe them . only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that , finally , it was safe to come out . " i was scared so much , " she recalled . @entity2 is a town about 90 miles from the @entity15 border . @entity13 is based in @entity15 , but it has n't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation . in 2013 militants attacked @entity19 's upscale @entity165 . saturday , the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming , as it promised " another bloodbath " in @entity1 . the threat drew a sharp response from @entity171 , the governor of @entity172 . " the fallacy and satanic mindset of @entity13 is that in @entity15 , they kill @entity67 and @entity15 , " @entity171 said . " they cross the border here and then say they are killing non-muslims . that is a tricky way of doing business . " he said the militants were " bent on nothing but destruction " and aimed to sow division between @entity67 and @entity180 . " but that is something we need to fight , " @entity171 said . five arrested in @entity1 attack police in @entity2 on saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack . the corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing . a large crowd gathered , despite the baking sun and foul stench . the truck drove up next to the onlookers , so that they could inspect the bodies . @entity211 seethed in the crowd . " these gunmen , they killed innocent children . we want to burn these people , " one man told @entity3 . @entity1 president @entity218 also had some harsh words saturday for @entity13 , as well as those who supported them . in a nationally televised speech , @entity218 said the nation 's fight against terrorism " has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary , harmless people . " @entity218 condemned " corruption of the worst and most criminal kind ( when ) @entity1 ... finance , hide and recruit on behalf of @entity13 . " " there is no form of legal penalty , social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve , to the fullest extent , " the president said . describing @entity13 as an " existential threat to our republic , " @entity218 urged his fellow @entity1 to " tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in @entity1 that we are one indivisible , sovereign and democratic state . " " that fight will never change , " he added . " our forefathers bled and died for this nation . and we will do everything to defend our way of life . " @entity218 declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack . @entity262 dorm 's scene of slaughter @entity3 's @entity264 reported from @entity2 and @entity265 and @entity266 reported from @entity1 . @entity3 's @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .
