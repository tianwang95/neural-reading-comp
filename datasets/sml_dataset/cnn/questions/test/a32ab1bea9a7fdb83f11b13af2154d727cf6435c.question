( @entity1 ) tickets will go on sale after an agreement on allocation was reached for the may 2 fight between @entity6 and @entity7 . in what @entity7 's promoter , @entity9 , dubbed the " fight of the century , " disagreements have hampered the release of the tickets because of questions over how many tickets would be allocated to each fighter for the highly - anticipated @entity18 event . " there was a craze for tickets and under our agreement with @entity24 , we felt we were being deprived of our fair share of the tickets ( from ) the standpoint of number and location , " @entity9 told @entity1 . " it was very , very important to my fighter @entity7 , to the @entity33 people ... @entity7 has friends and family like you ca n't believe -- that will be in account for 800 or 900 tickets themselves . " the cheapest tickets for the bout are priced at $ 1,500 but demand for the fight is such that some seats could fetch as much as $ 11,000 on the secondary market . @entity46 has been named as the referee of next month 's fight between @entity6 and @entity7 . the @entity49 said @entity46 , who has officiated more than 100 title contests , would take charge of the most anticipated bout in recent boxing history at the @entity54 . the 64 - year - old @entity56 native , who has refereed five of @entity6 's bouts and seven of @entity7 's , was described as " the best referee out there " by @entity7 's trainer @entity62 . and @entity49 executive director @entity63 said : " @entity46 knows the pressure , stress and responsibility . " he 's efficient and effective , and has proven to be successful over a number of years working in @entity18 and other parts of the world . he 's one of the best referees in the world . " the commission also confirmed that three @entity74 judges -- @entity75 and @entity76 of @entity56 and @entity77 of @entity78 -- had been appointed for the fight . " i think we have the best judges , and @entity46 is the best referee out there , " @entity62 said . " i think he 's going to give us a fair fight . " the welterweight world title fight is likely to smash all revenue records and become the richest bout in the sport 's history , eclipsing the pay - per - view record of 2.4 million viewers for @entity6 's fight against @entity92 in 2007 . speaking when the bout was confirmed in february , @entity7 said : " i am very happy that @entity6 and i can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years . " they have waited long enough , and they deserve it . " @entity6 and @entity7 have been considered the best pound - for - pound boxers of their generation but a host of issues -- including differences over drug testing protocols as well as revenue splits and broadcaster conflicts -- have stopped the two from meeting in the ring . both are coming to the end of their careers and have established interests elsewhere . according to @entity114 , @entity6 , 38 , is the highest paid athlete in world sport . @entity7 , who is 36 , has run for political office in his native @entity33 .
