( @entity2 ) in the beginning ... there was the @entity3 , and it was a very good book . but this @entity4 had n't read it -- at least , not from cover to cover . so , in the middle of @entity9 , i decided to finally take the plunge . let me explain . my name is @entity12 and i 'm a director of coverage at @entity2 , which means i manage our newsgathering and newsroom in @entity17 . i 'm also a lifelong @entity4 . at work this week , i was talking with some colleagues about @entity21 ' upcoming trip to the @entity22 . during the course of that conversation , i admitted something that has privately bothered me for a long time . i have never read the @entity3 from @entity26 to @entity27 . this from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest - ranking @entity4 in the bureau . my excuse always has been that @entity31 have their @entity3 passages read to them at @entity33 every sunday . and there are so many people that can so effortlessly quote long and beautiful passages . i love to read , there is no excuse . still , it made me wonder : why i had not read the good book cover to cover ? i took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my @entity44 , but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about . later , when i graduated , my grandparents gave me a beautiful bible that has traveled with me from @entity50 to @entity51 to @entity52 and finally to @entity17 . but in 24 years , i never so much as cracked the cover , other than to write the date i received the gift . in that newsroom conversation this week , @entity56 , the religion editor at @entity2 , suggested i read the @entity3 each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for @entity58 . i will admit to being pretty stunned and a little scared at the prospect . i figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process . i am no scholar , no expert on scripture , as should be obvious . but the more we talked , the more the idea grew on me . i have committed to training regimens for @entity68 and countless diets , so why not try this ? i have been looking for a form of meditation in my hectic life . this might just be it . my friends seem excited about this project , sending me some of their favorite passages , which i 'm keeping a list of . one @entity4 friend offered to join me , suggesting i get a blank journal to help me take notes . the colleague that i sit next to everyday has already sent me his @entity86 passage and wants to discuss it when i get there . another friend 's daughter is making her first @entity91 in may , and has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the @entity3 in school . so , in a way , i 'm going back to first grade in catholic school . yay for me . overall , my friends and family are mainly curious how this journey will end . i am , too . will i make it all the way to @entity27 come next spring ? i start on @entity103 . i hope you 'll join me .
