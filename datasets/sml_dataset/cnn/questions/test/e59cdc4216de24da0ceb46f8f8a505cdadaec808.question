( @entity1 ) @entity0 , to say the least , knows his way around politics . in a @entity6 appearance recently , the retired congressman had the sold - out crowd at the @entity8 well entertained as he detailed his 45 - year journey in public service . @entity0 , you 'll recall , was the first member of @entity13 to marry someone of the same - sex while in office , and among other things , he had some choice words for closeted politicians who vote against lgbt rights . and when someone in the audience asked his thoughts about a current ballot proposal in @entity25 that would legalize killing gay people , he said he was n't aware of the measure but told the young man not to " worry yourself about the crazy people . " " we 're winning , " he said before joking that the name of the @entity25 proposal -- " @entity32 " -- sounded like a porno . " we 're winning " is a phrase i 've heard a lot recently as it pertains to lgbt rights . and i guess if you look at where the country was 10 years ago , we definitely are . that 's assuming you are part of the " we " that believes @entity38 people should have the same rights as their heterosexual / cisgender counterparts . or at least not " be put to death by bullets to the head or by any other convenient method " as the @entity25 proposal suggests . ( it 's unclear whether @entity52 , the @entity53 lawyer who submitted the proposal , is being sincere or just an ass , but the fact remains that if he collects enough signatures there appears to be no legal way of stopping it from going on the ballot . ) @entity0 's " we 're winning " declaration was oddly timed , too . less than 24 hours after his talk , the governor in the next state over signed an @entity65 " religious freedom " bill into the law -- one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation . " many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , " @entity77 gov. @entity76 said . not to be outdone , @entity84 gov. @entity83 said he would sign a similar bill that is expected to reach his desk shortly . so we have : a fledgling proposal to kill the gays out @entity89 , laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland , and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful @entity95 is a barometer , a federal ban on same - sex marriage still on the @entity100 table . like others , i had foolishly hoped the upcoming general election would be one defined by bold ideas . instead , it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity109 's " cultural war " speech , during which he told the @entity110 : " we stand with ( @entity112 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women " and later followed with " there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity128 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity132 . " progressives enjoyed poking fun at @entity95 , the @entity136 darling when he announced his presidential bid , but according to the @entity144 , " the @entity138 [ @entity139 ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . " it 's not just lawmakers . @entity152 @entity151 chief justice @entity150 made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state 's ban on same - sex marriage . and this week . a federal judge in @entity95 's home state of @entity163 blocked a federal rule that would have granted married , same - sex couples access to the @entity165 , a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse . it seems clear that even if @entity95 does n't capture the @entity100 nomination , whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease lgbt rights backlash currently underway in conservative states . that could include one of @entity95 's agenda items : a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , usurping whatever ruling comes out of the @entity151 in june , when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected . and the @entity184 can issue strongly worded statements , as it did over @entity77 's new @entity65 law , and -- along with others in corporate america -- can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws . but at the end of the day , it 's about votes . @entity0 said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , " winning " is going to feel very strange . indeed , most 2016 hopefuls on the right have been reluctant to express support for same - sex marriage . according to former @entity84 gov. @entity209 , " it 's like asking someone who 's @entity205 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . " @entity211 gov. @entity210 said , " i certainly will support @entity95 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . " @entity218 gov. @entity217 has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions . and @entity222 said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . ( he later apologized ) @entity227 polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . @entity0 said he believes republicans want the @entity151 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity100 primary . that may be true , but it 's doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called " religious freedom " bills currently snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop -- especially with @entity100 controlling both the @entity253 and the @entity254 . once again , our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two - party system . socially liberal , fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate 's policies before making a decision , but ultimately it may come down to a single - question : to discriminate against @entity38 people or not . unfortunately , the pending 2016 " cultural war " does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that . i know @entity0 and others have said " we 're winning " but sitting here , watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory .

@entity277 : @placeholder may say lgbt rights ' winning , ' but @entity77 law pushing them back , and other states ' anti-lgbt moves , a bad sign
