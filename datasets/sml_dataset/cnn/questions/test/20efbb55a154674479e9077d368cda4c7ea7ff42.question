( @entity1 ) this article contains language that may be offensive to some . since the news broke last weekend that @entity5 had declared her candidacy , notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous " @entity5 , " as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit . the @entity12 published an item titled " @entity14 backs @entity5 for president " while gossip site @entity16 refers to the former @entity18 , @entity20 senator , and secretary of state on a first - name basis throughout its news story on the announcement . even @entity25 posted a piece about the run called " there 's nothing inevitable about @entity5 . " she 's famous enough by now to go by one name , but should she ? while @entity32 is arguably more widely known than any of her to - date opponents , she 's also a former @entity20 senator and secretary of state . she 's not @entity36 . and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we 've long called @entity32 by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n't do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power . according to a @entity46 study , @entity32 was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival , @entity49 , and so it goes this time around . after all , @entity51 's also running for president . so is @entity53 . when those guys declared , however , they got headlines that included their last names . there 's a very good reason for that . presidential candidates are not just professionals , but professionals declaring their candidacy for a position that many consider to be the most powerful in the world . a position that not only deserves formality and respect , but within a global context seems to require it . being president of the @entity20 is a serious job . are there " @entity76 " signs in our future ? unlikely . were we encouraged to " @entity80 " ? nope . the @entity81 , meanwhile , is one of the most regimented organizations in the world , whose values put dignity and respect at top priority . cadets do n't call their commanding officers by their first names , even -- maybe especially -- if they 're women . so why are we all referring to the possible next commander - in - chief as if we 're part of her circle of close pals ? before you point to the fact that @entity32 is not the first @entity32 to cross this particular political threshold , the issue at hand is not one of practicality : the @entity20 public is smart enough to distinguish between this @entity32 and that @entity32 . @entity104 was n't the first in his family to run for office , and when he did , legitimate newspapers did n't go around noting the " w " ( or even " @entity104 " ) was up for the job . he was just @entity104 , as he should have been , just as @entity32 is just @entity32 , a woman who has done a very good job distinguishing herself from her husband without the need to be referred to by her first name in order to avoid a case of mistaken identity . of course , the mononymity does n't seem to be unwelcome : sections of @entity32 's website invite readers to " like @entity127 " and read about " @entity123 , " while the campaign 's official hashtag appears to be # @entity126 . her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that " it 's official : @entity5 's running for president . " perhaps @entity32 and her advisers believe the single name makes her more personable , and familiar . maybe it 's an effort to distance @entity32 from the other gender - based stereotype slapped on her the last time around , when she was " the bitch " to @entity142 's " ditz . " but while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it 's far more important to trust , and respect , her -- and that still requires a level of formality . it 's important for the @entity20 public to be able to imagine electing a leader not despite the fact that she 's a woman , or even because she 's a woman , but who , very simply , happens to be a woman . whether she endorses the idea or not , calling @entity32 by her first name serves to , at best , reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be " approachable , " not abrasive or aloof , in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst , infantilize and put her in her place . there 's a reason , after all , that we address current and former presidents as mr. president when we meet them , and not " hey , @entity171 ! " and if there 's a reason @entity5 will be elected as our next president , it 's not because she let us call her @entity5 .

@entity178 : media , even candidate herself call @entity32 just ' @placeholder . ' this reinforces stereotypes about women needing to be approachable
