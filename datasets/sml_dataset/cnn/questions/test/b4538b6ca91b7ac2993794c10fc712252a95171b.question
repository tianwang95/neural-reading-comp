( @entity2 ) talk show host dr. @entity0 is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of " manifesting an egregious lack of integrity " in his tv and promotional work and who call his faculty position at @entity11 unacceptable . in a written statement issued last week , @entity0 said , " i bring the public information that will help them on their path to be their best selves . we provide multiple points of view , including mine which is offered without conflict of interest . that does n't sit well with certain agendas which distort the facts . for example , i do not claim that @entity30 ( genetically modified organism ) foods are dangerous , but believe that they should be labeled like they are in most countries around the world . i will address this on the show next week . " that show was taped on tuesday and in a clip posted online after the taping , he tells his audience he will not be silenced . the episode will air on thursday afternoon in most markets , friday in others . it all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to @entity11 expressing disapproval that @entity49 is on the faculty . the email sent to @entity11 's faculty dean for @entity53 , dr. @entity54 , said the group is " surprised and dismayed " that @entity49 is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position . @entity49 is vice chair of the @entity59 , at @entity60 . the email was sent by dr. @entity62 , a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at @entity66 's @entity65 . it was signed by nine other physicians from across the country , none of whom is affiliated with @entity11 . they accuse @entity49 of what they call " manifesting an egregious lack of integrity by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal financial gain . " they go on to say @entity49 has " either outrageous conflicts of interest or flawed judgments about what constitutes appropriate medical treatments , or both . " the doctors argue in their emailed letter that @entity49 shows " disdain for science and for evidence - based medicine , as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops . " it 's worth noting that @entity62 previously worked at the @entity97 , at one point reviewing genetically engineered drugs . as an example , they cite an investigation reported on the show in 2011 in which apple juice was presented as having unsafe levels of arsenic . the @entity97 disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible . this is not the first time @entity49 has been called out . he was in the hot seat on @entity113 at a june 2014 hearing on false advertising for deceptive weight loss products featured on his show . sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , and chairwoman of the @entity122 on @entity123 , product safety and @entity125 , said at the hearing he was perpetuating scams , whether it was intentional or not . @entity62 and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment , saying @entity49 is misleading the public and they tell @entity11 's @entity133 that having him on the faculty is unacceptable . the doctors , who are in different areas of the country and different facets of the medical community , all have a connection to @entity62 although they do not all know each other . @entity2 has reached out to all of them . those who have responded say @entity62 invited them to sign the email . @entity149 , @entity150 , anesthesiologist dr. @entity148 told @entity2 when she received an email from @entity62 inviting her to sign the email to @entity11 , she said of course . " he 's a charlatan , and @entity11 elevating him to a position of authority is a credence and platform for misleading more people , " she said in a phone interview . @entity162 was a classmate of @entity62 's at @entity164 . dr. @entity165 , a radiology professor at the @entity166 , is also a former classmate of @entity62 's . he told @entity2 he does not have a vendetta against @entity168 said he just wants him to " follow the basic rules of science and state what he knows as fact as fact and state what he does n't know as fact as not fact . " he and @entity162 share @entity119 's example of @entity49 's promotion of " miracle weight loss drugs " on the show as failure on @entity49 's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm . dr. @entity191 , professor emeritus of medicine and of cellular and molecular medicine at the @entity194 , wrote in a letter to @entity2 : " in discussions with @entity62 , i agreed that the imprimatur of @entity60 behind dr. @entity0 gave an inaccurate message to tv viewers and as dr. @entity54 and i are long time colleagues i was comfortable pointing out these problems to him . " @entity62 worked in @entity205 's research lab before he went to medical school . while the email does not call for any specific action to be taken by the university , @entity62 told @entity2 in an email that the group 's goal is " for dr. @entity0 to resign from the @entity11 faculty and decide that he 'd prefer a career as a tv celebrity doctor . " @entity49 spokesman @entity216 sent an email to @entity2 last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about @entity49 the email questions the integrity and even the qualifications of those who are pointing fingers at @entity49 for its part , @entity11 is standing by @entity49 spokesman @entity233 said in a statement , " @entity11 is committed to the principle of academic freedom and to upholding faculty members ' freedom of expression for statements they make in public discussion . " @entity233 added that the university 's role is to foster research , and it will not take action that hinders public statements by faculty members . the university has no position on what faculty members say in public discussion -- that is their individual academic freedom and is provided to them in the university 's governing documents , he said . a cardiac surgeon , @entity49 came to @entity11 for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks . he is also the director of the @entity254 and @entity256 program at @entity257 . @entity49 rose to fame after frequent appearances on " the @entity260 " led to the creation of his own show and magazine . he is also co-founder of the consumer health website @entity266 . @entity2 's @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .
