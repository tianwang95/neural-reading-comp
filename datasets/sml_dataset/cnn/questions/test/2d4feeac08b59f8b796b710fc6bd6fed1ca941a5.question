( @entity1 ) you 'll see him in your @entity3 . on thursday night 's " @entity7 , " dr. @entity4 -- the hunky character played by @entity6 -- died . he was n't shot down over the @entity8 , nor did a helicopter fall on his head . instead , he died following a car crash -- after helping victims of another accident . " @entity4 is and will always be an incredibly important character -- for @entity18 ( @entity7 ) , for me and for the fans , " show creator @entity14 said in a statement , according to @entity16 . " i absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ' @entity4 . ' @entity6 's performance shaped @entity4 in a way that i know we both hope became a meaningful example -- happy , sad , romantic , painful and always true -- of what young women should demand from modern love . his loss will be felt by all . " intriguingly , @entity6 still has a year left on his contract . his character 's death leaves his tv wife , dr. @entity34 ( @entity35 ) , as the show 's mainstay as it concludes its 11th season in may . " it 's been a remarkable ride , " @entity6 told @entity39 . " the worldwide impact has been extraordinary . it is incredible how devoted and passionate the fans are , and i will forever be grateful and humbled by the experience . " " @entity7 " fans are still in shock . @entity49 ran an obituary for the character . # @entity52 was a trending hashtag on @entity54 . tweets from " @entity7 's " official account were filled with emoji of crying faces and broken hearts , as well as tearful images from the show . some chose to remember the good times , but for others , there was a big sense of betrayal . but the show will very much continue -- not only does it have a few weeks before the 11th season is over , @entity35 is also signed through season 12 . the theme of this season , @entity14 had said , was @entity7 's ability to stand on her own . now without her husband -- who was already devoting his life to separate concerns as a presidential aide -- she 'll truly have to do so . " @entity7 , " though not the powerhouse it was when it premiered in 2005 , still does well in the ratings . for the week ending april 19 , the most recent available , it was 20th in overall viewers and 12th among the desirable adults 18 - 49 demographic . and @entity6 , who also races cars , is n't going anywhere . he has a development deal with @entity88 , " @entity7 " producers .
