( @entity1 ) one of the two @entity3 students expelled for their role in leading a racist chant has issued an apology , the @entity0 reported . " i am deeply sorry for what i did saturday night . it was wrong and reckless . i made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same , " @entity11 said in a statement printed by the newspaper . earlier tuesday , @entity11 and another student were expelled over their alleged " leadership role " in a racist chant by @entity22 fraternity members , a decision that president @entity24 says speaks to his school 's " zero tolerance " policy for such " threatening racist behavior . " the decision comes two days after a video of frat members singing a racist song surfaced and hours after @entity24 told @entity1 he would suspend or expel the group 's ringleaders if at all possible . " at this point , all i can do is be thoughtful and prayerful about my next steps , but i am also concerned about the fraternity friends still on campus . apparently , they are feeling unsafe and some have been harassed by others . hopefully , the university will protect them , " @entity11 reportedly said in his apology . already , the @entity46 , alpha and epsilon have been removed from the frat house 's facade , the house will be closed as of midnight tuesday and the university will board up the windows , following up on separate decisions by the university and the @entity22 national headquarters to shutter the @entity3 chapter , @entity24 said . @entity58 's house mom sings n - word @entity11 has not responded to multiple requests from @entity1 for comment . " for me , this is a devastating lesson and i am seeking guidance on how i can learn from this and make sure it never happens again . my goal for the long - term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever i see or experience it in the future , " his apology read . it was only a nine - second clip , but the backlash has been disastrous . party - bound students are seen on a bus clapping , pumping their fists and laughing as they chant , " there will never be a ni * * * * @entity22 . you can hang him from a tree , but he can never sign with me . there will never be a ni * * * * @entity22 . " after the campus organization , @entity86 , and the school newspaper received the clip via anonymous messages and publicized it , the university and the fraternity 's national chapter acted swiftly to shutter the @entity22 house in @entity95 . @entity24 promised the university 's affiliation with the fraternity was done . " i was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video , " said @entity99 , the fraternity 's national president . " @entity22 is a diverse organization , and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior . " still , it could get worse . @entity3 may not be the only source of embarrassment for the fraternity . " several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders , and each of those instances will be investigated for further action , " @entity22 said . it 's likely that if the university had n't acted , the @entity122 's @entity121 could have stepped in , said @entity124 , president and executive director of the @entity126 . @entity135 of the @entity136 " prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color , and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance , " according to the @entity122 . in this case , @entity124 said , the university likely found that fraternity members appear not only to have discriminated in their membership -- and backed that discrimination with the threat of lynching -- but they 've also created a hostile environment . the university , she said , " would 've been compelled to do something to sanction and prevent this fraternity from engaging in racial discrimination . " @entity124 said she was n't personally familiar with the school 's code of conduct , but she 'd be surprised if the fraternity members ' actions were n't in violation of university rules as well . all of these reasons are grounds to sanction the fraternity and expel specific members who were involved in the singing , she said . " a very important part of the lexicon of civil rights law is that you can not create a hostile environment where you make it so people of different races or religions or women feel they ca n't function at your institution without being subjected to unlawful discrimination , " she said . it 's unclear whether more students will be punished for the video , though @entity24 has promised the @entity174 wo n't return during his tenure if he can help it . " the house will be closed , and as far as i 'm concerned , they wo n't be back , " he said at a monday news conference . he later told @entity1 , " there seems to be a culture in some of these fraternities , and it just has to be snuffed out . " the decision to shutter the fraternity was an easy one for @entity24 , he said . " if we 're ever going to snuff this out in the whole country , let alone on college campuses , we 're going to have to have zero tolerance , and we have to act right away , " said @entity24 , a former @entity185 governor and @entity187 senator . " this is not a place that wants racists or bigots on our campus or will tolerate it , so i think you have to send a very strong signal . " hundreds of students have protested the fraternity 's actions . some of them arrived monday morning on the campus ' @entity206 with tape over their mouths , while the @entity3 football team and coach @entity211 marched arm in arm across campus instead of practicing . the video infuriated @entity3 linebacker @entity216 , who posted a profanity - laced video to social media . " i was angry and i was outraged , " striker said . " i apologize for the profanity , but i 'm not apologizing about how i felt , because that 's how i felt in my heart . " the fallout from the video also cost the football team a top recruit as offensive lineman @entity227 said monday he was de-committing from the @entity228 and considering other teams . just as they protested loudly monday , students on tuesday were emphatic in expressing their relief and satisfaction that those allegedly responsible for leading the racist chant got their due . @entity234 , a senior studying drama and broadcast media , called the video embarrassing and unacceptable as he worried that it may be seen as a reflection on him in the future . " it sucks that i 'm graduating in may . i feel i am probably going to have to explain this when i move , " he said . " for people who do n't know the @entity3 , are n't part of the student body , it 's a black eye that does n't really deserve to be there . it 's a small group of people who were acting foolishly . " another student , junior @entity248 , applauded the university and the fraternity 's national president for their handling of the incident . " i think it 's really good that the president is showing strong support for the students in the community here and saying , ' this is not ok . it 's not going to be acceptable on our campus . ' it 's a good strong move , and i hope if they find out more , they do more , " he said . shortly after the expulsions were announced , senior @entity267 , an @entity268 modern dance student , told @entity1 , " i think it 's rightfully so that they were ( kicked out ) . ... that needed to happen . it was n't fair ; it was n't right . i am , as most of the student body -- not just the @entity268 students -- we 're all disheartened by the situation . it 's just really hard to think that this is still going on today , and i 'm still deeply saddened . " he is still a " proud student , " he said , and he understands that the fraternity members in question represent " just some microbial infestation that 's on campus . it 's on every campus , it 's on every campus . it 's unfortunate that we have to be seen in that light . " asked what he could say to the fraternity members if given the chance , @entity267 replied , " i pray for their humanity . i hope that they find maturity . ... i wish them well . " unheard co-director @entity298 said a racist mentality is not new to campus and is not confined to one fraternity . " unfortunately , it took them getting caught on video camera for this to happen , but this is definitely not something that is brand - new . it 's not something that 's only seen within this one organization , " she said . @entity22 is no stranger to scandal and sanctions @entity315 said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend , as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved . " i was hurt that my fellow peers that i walk to class with every day , people that i see every day , could say such hateful things about me and my culture , about my friends , about my brothers and my sisters , " she said . @entity327 , who was a member of the frat between 2001 and 2005 , called the episode " devastating " -- not just because he 's an @entity3 alumnus but also because he 's @entity268 . @entity327 told @entity1 that there was " never an inkling of this song or a whisper of anything like this " when he lived in the house . he said members of his pledge class " would n't let that happen , " and if someone did dare to start such a chant they 'd swiftly speak out and shut it down " whether i was there or not . " since the video surfaced , @entity327 said he 's heard from many of his former fraternity brothers . like him , they 're offended and supportive of the decision to shutter the @entity95 chapter . " i do n't know what happened to the culture of my home , " he said . " that is not my home . that is not @entity22 . they are not my brothers . " opinion : are frats ' a form of @entity268 apartheid ' ? @entity1 's @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , @entity364 , @entity365 and @entity366 contributed to this report .
