( @entity0 ) be afraid -- be very afraid . this is the warning the world deserves to hear . because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century : the fruits of radical @entity8 . the results of the @entity12 @entity11 's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever - growing numbers of victims of radical @entity8 in the @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 . not to mention here in the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 . is it not a tragic irony that the @entity27 - era policies of a @entity29 recipient accommodated the transition of @entity31 into the world 's newest jihad theater while leaving @entity34 a failed state and @entity36 a failing state ? the @entity31 jihad gave rise to the @entity40 in @entity41 and @entity31 , which now uses @entity31 as a rear operating base to support its jihad in @entity41 , which could soon spill over into @entity44 . plus , @entity34 is now being used as a rear operating base by @entity46 and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the @entity17 , even as they plan attacks in @entity23 and @entity50 . given the frightfully slow pace @entity50 's commander - in - chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both @entity46 and its progenitor , @entity58 , the picture of what 's in store is clear : the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy - in for their agendas . and neither the @entity21 nor our @entity68 allies are immune to this cancer . academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of @entity46 and @entity58 as distinctly different . but the fact is they are not -- their agendas , which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today , are manifestations of radical @entity8 . of course , it 's hardly a surprise president @entity12 refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven na√Øve , with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is , but as they hope it could be . there is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world 's most powerful politician and his national security team . just take the @entity100 published by the @entity11 in 2011 . that document contained the assertion that , " since the beginning of 2011 , the transformative change sweeping @entity18 and the @entity17 -- along with the death of @entity105 -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat , par - ticularly as the relevance of @entity58 and its ideology has been further diminished . " yet , fast forward to january 2014 and @entity50 's top intelligence official , director of national intelligence @entity112 , advised @entity114 that @entity58 was no less capable of threatening the @entity21 and our allies than a decade earlier . soon after @entity112 acknowledged @entity58 was not a band on the run , as president @entity12 had described the terrorist enterprise , a report by terrorism expert @entity122 of the @entity123 highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the @entity11 : as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like @entity34 , @entity131 and @entity132 during the @entity27 , those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including @entity58 and groups aligned with it . according to data compiled by @entity122 , from 2010 through 2013 , the number of @entity138 jihadist groups increased by 58 % . these groups are fueled by @entity141 , an ideology that not only informs the agenda of @entity58 , but is the source code for the agenda of the @entity58 offshoot @entity46 . most recently , absent from the @entity146 produced by the @entity12 @entity11 in february 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by @entity58 . yes , @entity105 was killed on president @entity12 's watch . but contrary to what the @entity11 seemed to think in 2011 , @entity105 's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over @entity50 's , or our allies ' security . indeed , within days of our new @entity146 's publication date , in the seventh issue of @entity46 's @entity159 @entity160 , the group 's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by @entity105 , while accusing his successor , @entity165 , of steering @entity58 off the path of its former leader . meanwhile , @entity36 -- home to @entity168 , the @entity58 branch that claimed credit for the january 2015 attack in @entity171 at the office of @entity173 -- has also become a failed state . @entity168 is helmed by the second - highest - ranking official in @entity58 writ large , and the @entity12 administration views it as the most dangerous component of @entity58 's global network . so it is interesting that , in the months before the @entity36 government was overthrown by @entity182 - backed rebels , president @entity12 described the @entity21 - @entity36 counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against @entity58 -- interesting because the president did not do more to help that " partner " government remain in power . once again , the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the @entity17 . what were they thinking ? and how do they plan to combat @entity168 now ? despite what the @entity11 wants the world to believe , a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities : @entity46 controls a large amount of territory in the @entity17 , and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as @entity34 and @entity208 , while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the @entity210 . and , although @entity46 is trying to " out @entity58 " @entity58 , resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world , @entity58 itself is no less of a threat to the @entity21 and our allies today than it was in january 2014 . at the same time , the routine failures of president @entity12 and his advisers to understand the security environment , and to appropriately tailor @entity50 's national security posture in a manner demanded by it , foretells more disasters lie ahead . not only @entity21 , but also our allies should be very , very afraid . indeed , president @entity12 's refusal to simply call a problem like radical @entity8 by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical @entity235 groups . history has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders do n't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it . president @entity12 has the resources at his disposal to do just that . but if he wants to help define a future for the @entity17 and @entity18 in which fewer threats emanate from those regions , he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes - men surrounding him at the @entity11 . there is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe . indeed , president @entity12 should also pay closer attention to what representatives from @entity268 states are saying behind closed doors . most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating @entity46 and @entity58 . however , all of them recognize that , unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better , the @entity21 will have to deploy considerably more of our " kinetic " resources to put those victories in sight . this does not mean a ground forces - intensive response is required from us at this time . but if the president thinks it prudent to wait on our @entity268 partners to do most of the heavy lifting , he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not - too - distant future .
