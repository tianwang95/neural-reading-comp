( @entity8 ) when 65 cases of 20 - year - old @entity2 -- one of the rarest and most expensive bourbons in the world -- were reported missing from a @entity7 distillery in october 2013 , it was the crime heard round the whiskey - drinking world . @entity11 sheriff @entity10 , the man leading the investigation into the estimated $ 26,000 in missing @entity13 , said at the time that the high - end heist was " indicative of an inside job . " but ever since , the trail went largely cold . until now . on tuesday , a @entity11 grand jury indicted " nine members of a criminal syndicate that collaborated to promote or engage in the theft ... and illegal trafficking " of liquor from two different @entity7 distilleries : @entity25 's @entity24 -- makers of @entity13 -- and the nearby @entity27 , makers of the eponymous bourbon , according to the indictment . just like making good bourbon -- a specific type of whiskey synonymous with the @entity7 -- @entity10 's case required time to develop and old - fashioned @entity7 ingenuity . the sheriff 's hunch was reflected in the indictment : of the nine named , two worked at @entity24 and one worked at @entity27 . the alleged ringleader , according to assistant commonwealth attorney @entity40 , is @entity42 , a 45 - year - old loading dock worker at the @entity24 . @entity42 and his wife , @entity43 , each face eight charges for allegedly engaging in organized crime . @entity42 -- who has worked at @entity24 for more than 20 years -- was arrested in march after authorities , acting on a tip , found five barrels of bourbon behind a shed on his property , according to @entity8 affiliate @entity52 . those barrels , weighing more than 500 pounds each and worth up to $ 6,000 apiece , had recently been stolen from @entity27 , @entity10 told @entity55 's @entity54 . while an additional search warrant allegedly turned up illegal steroids from @entity42 's home , there was no sign of any @entity13 . " he does n't know anything about ( stolen @entity2 ) , " his mother , @entity61 , told @entity8 last month . in fact , she said , once he bonded out of jail , @entity42 returned to his job at @entity24 . however , according to @entity10 , " @entity42 was involved in numerous thefts of @entity2 , as well as @entity69 bourbon , both in bottles and barrels . " @entity10 said @entity42 distributed the highly coveted bourbon through a network of connections in his softball league . @entity61 did not immediately return a message tuesday . but @entity78 's attorney , @entity77 , told the @entity79 of @entity80 , " we 've been waiting patiently for this to happen . we 're glad that if they 're going to indict that they 've indicted so we can get to work . " at a press conference announcing the indictments , @entity10 got emotional as he described the tremendous amount of effort put into the investigation . " ( @entity11 detectives ) have done an absolute incredible job , " he said as he choked back tears . " and i 'm thrilled to have been a part of it . " @entity96 , the whiskey blogger , got a different kind of emotional tug from what flanked the sheriff : several hundred thousand dollars ' worth of recovered booze -- including 20 cases of @entity13 . whether those 20 were among the 65 that vanished is not immediately known , but that did n't matter to @entity96 . " on behalf of bourbon lovers everywhere , we are thrilled that the @entity13 is back ! "
