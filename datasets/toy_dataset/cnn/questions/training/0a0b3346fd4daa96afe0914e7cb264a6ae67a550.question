@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- @entity3 , we hardly knew ye . or should i say , " primo ! " as much as it embarrasses me to admit it , given some of his views and how he expresses them , the presumptive @entity13 presidential nominee and i could be distant cousins . @entity16 's father , @entity15 , was born in @entity17 , @entity18 , and so was my grandfather , @entity19 . @entity20 ? you did n't know that @entity16 was half - @entity22 ? it 's true . in fact , if he makes it to the @entity29 , in addition to becoming the first mormon in the @entity27 , he could also be the nation 's first @entity31 president . do n't laugh . technically , @entity16 is just as " @entity22 " as former @entity18 gov. @entity33 , who was born of a @entity22 mother and @entity36 father . when @entity33 ran for the @entity29 in 2008 , he was often touted by the media as someone who would become the nation 's first @entity31 president . yet , i would imagine that a lot of @entity36 are n't aware of this branch of the @entity16 family tree , and that 's because it is not a detail that @entity16 usually talks about publicly -- and especially not on the campaign trail . that changed this week when @entity16 -- in talking about his father , a self - made man who worked his way up from nothing to become head of @entity53 , governor of @entity55 and a @entity13 presidential candidate in 1968 -- told a crowd at the @entity58 in @entity59 that his father was born in @entity18 and came to the @entity36 at 5 . @entity16 's great - grandfather , @entity61 , fled the @entity36 and crossed into @entity18 in 1885 to escape religious persecution . he helped build the @entity26 enclave of @entity64 in @entity17 . @entity61 never became a @entity22 citizen , and neither did his son , @entity67 , or grandson , @entity15 . they were all denied @entity22 citizenship because statutes on the books in @entity18 denied that right to @entity36 settlers and their offspring . speaking to the crowd in @entity59 , @entity16 compared his father 's story to those of countless other immigrants who have come to this country seeking economic opportunity . my grandfather , a @entity22 citizen , also came to the @entity36 legally as a child in the early 1900s with his family , trying to escape the chaos of the @entity88 . it was during the same time that @entity16 's grandfather , @entity67 , returned to the @entity36 with his family , also legally and presumably for the same reason now , hold on to your sombrero . i 'm an @entity36 , born in the @entity36 to parents who were born in the @entity36 . in fact , three of my four grandparents were born in the @entity36 . and yet , growing up , people in my hometown in @entity99 referred to me and other @entity100 like me as " @entity22 . " that was the shorthand . but comparing bloodlines , you could say that @entity16 is more " @entity22 " than i am . after all , @entity16 is just one generation removed from our ancestral homeland ; i 'm two . this is ironic given that i 've spent the last 20 years criticizing politicians who twist the facts , propose simple solutions and pick on those who do n't have a voice . and @entity16 has spent the last several months doing precisely that , just like he did during his failed 2008 presidential bid . he has used illegal immigration as a weapon against @entity13 opponents who propose reasonable solutions and in the process portrayed illegal immigrants , most of whom come from @entity18 , as takers who come to the @entity36 for free public benefits and ought not be rewarded with " amnesty . " we can expect @entity16 to continue that theme over the next week as he campaigns in @entity128 , where @entity13 primary voters will cast ballots on january 21 and where illegal immigration is a bigger issue than in @entity132 or @entity59 . lawmakers in the @entity128 recently passed a tough @entity135 - style immigration law that requires local and state police to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect to be an illegal immigrant ( read : @entity140 ) . it 's an approach that is wildly unpopular with @entity140 and which has the blessing of most of the @entity13 running for president , including @entity16 . and that 's one reason why @entity16 , even if he is the @entity13 nominee for president , does n't have much of a chance with @entity31 voters . political experts say that a @entity13 would have to earn at least 30 % of the @entity31 vote to win the @entity29 . given how he behaved in the primaries , @entity16 will be lucky to get 20 % . in fact , a recent poll of @entity31 voters by the @entity152 put the figure at 23 % . while it found a high level of anger with president @entity158 among @entity140 over his aggressive deportation policies , the poll also found that -- in a @entity158 - @entity16 matchup -- the @entity160 would easily beat the @entity13 , 68 % to 23 % . that 's saying something given that , according to the survey , @entity158 's job approval rating with @entity140 is just 49 % . the takeaway : you want to make @entity158 more popular with @entity140 ? easy . pit him against @entity16 . listen to @entity169 , a @entity170 - based advertising executive and @entity13 strategist who has advised @entity172 and @entity173 . a few months ago , @entity169 told the @entity174 that @entity16 had blown his chance with @entity140 . " ( @entity16 ) can make as many trips to @entity177 and @entity18 and @entity178 and other swing states that have a large @entity31 population , " said @entity169 , " but he can write off the @entity31 vote . " it was @entity16 who recently promised to veto the @entity185 if he 's elected president and if @entity188 passes the bill . the legislation , which would allow undocumented students to stay in the country legally if they complete a college degree or join the military , is extremely popular with @entity140 . it was @entity16 who first attacked @entity197 gov. @entity196 for signing a law that allows illegal immigrants who live in @entity197 to pay in - state tuition at public colleges and universities . and it was @entity16 who later attacked former house speaker @entity205 for declaring that the @entity13 should n't support splitting up families and proposing a pathway for the undocumented to work legally in the @entity36 . it was @entity16 who , in the debates , came across as naive by suggesting that the illegal immigration problem could be solved by simply putting more " boots on the ground " and as dishonest by not acknowledging the contributions that illegal immigrants make to the local , state and national economies . and it was @entity16 whose campaign put up , in @entity59 , an offensive television ad that attacked @entity196 by linking him to @entity18 and former @entity22 president @entity221 , because @entity222 happened to agree with the @entity197 governor on letting illegal immigrants pay in - state tuition . so the candidate who winds up vilifying @entity18 is the same one whose father was born in @entity18 ? who can make sense of this ? listen up , @entity3 . you 've made your bed . you 're persona non grata with @entity31 voters , and it 's your own fault . you ca n't win without them , but they can help make sure you lose . we do n't care where your family 's from . what matters is where your heart is . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243
