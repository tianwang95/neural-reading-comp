( @entity0 ) -- the e-mail arrived from @entity2 on february 26 . it was titled " @entity4 . " @entity7 had intended to study business , but changed his mind after 9/11 , his academic adviser said . " @entity10 , " a young woman named @entity12 wrote in shaky @entity13 . " very very bad news ! ! ! @entity7 is given 8 years of prison . today was the verdict . now i feel myself very bad . and i ca n't write now . i am shocked . " " it was like being kicked in the stomach , " recalled @entity18 , a retired flight attendant living in @entity19 , @entity20 . she knew @entity7 's husband , @entity7 , as an @entity2 exchange student who had wanted to help heal people after the 9/11 attacks . she thought of him as an open - minded muslim whom her family had hosted when he came on a scholarship to study at @entity31 in 2001 . " we were totally shocked that someone like @entity7 could be arrested for anything , " @entity18 said . " we have n't stopped worrying about his safety . " the 32 - year - old faces eight years in a labor camp for participation in what the @entity2 government says is an extremist religious organization , according to @entity43 , a religious freedom watchdog organization the group says that @entity2 security forces arrested @entity7 and four other men -- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 -- last summer after the men had written for an @entity54 journal called @entity55 . the @entity56 reportedly claimed the magazine was " sponsored by a @entity58 radical religious movement . " officials from the @entity61 in @entity62 have refused to comment on the case . @entity43 says @entity7 and the four other @entity2 men were convicted of " dissemination of information and materials containing ideas of religious extremism , separatism and fundamentalism , calls for pogroms or violent eviction of individuals aimed at creating panic among the population . " human rights organizations say the convictions appear to be part of a broader crackdown in the former @entity82 republic , targeting members of " @entity84 , " a moderate @entity27 movement of @entity58 origin , which follows the writing of a 19th - century @entity27 theologian . " unfortunately this is not an unusual case , " said @entity89 , a researcher with @entity90 in @entity91 . " the [ @entity2 ] government has persisted in its persecution of independent @entity96 . " thousands of miles from the @entity2 , news of @entity7 's jail sentence has stunned academics and @entity102 community leaders in @entity20 . they fondly describe a committed social activist and observant @entity27 , who rode between work and classes on a secondhand bicycle and spent more than a year distributing food to soup kitchens in one of @entity112 's poorer cities . " he had a naive trust in the goodness of human beings , " said @entity113 , an administrator at the @entity114 . " i am shocked . i know he is there [ in prison ] unjustly . what is happening is unjust . " " he was a man of his word , he was gentle and kind , " said @entity123 , the director of @entity124 , a nonprofit organization that distributes food to homeless people in @entity127 . " our common bond was feeding people who ca n't feed themselves and clothing those people who ca n't clothe themselves . " @entity7 's academic adviser , @entity137 , said the young @entity2 originally intended to study business when he arrived at @entity31 on a scholarship from the @entity140 of the @entity141 . that changed september 11 , 2001 . @entity143 choked up as she recalled his visit to her office , hours after the terrorist attacks . " he said , ' dr. @entity143 , i have to do something to tell people that this is not what @entity54 is about . ' he said , ' i want to be part of things that are done here to bring healing to people after 9/11 . ' " @entity7 began working closely with @entity143 's husband , pastor @entity143 , who was a @entity159 minister and the executive director of the @entity114 . pastor @entity143 helped @entity7 tour churches and work with synagogues , giving lectures on his interpretation of @entity54 . @entity7 also appeared before audiences dressed in traditional @entity169 attire , in an effort to spread cultural awareness about @entity2 . advisers say the young @entity2 was inspired by his interaction with church and community groups . gradually , he shifted his academic focus from business to grassroots community service and education reform . " he would regularly say ' wow , how can i do this in @entity2 , and make my country and my community better and stronger ? ' " @entity137 explained . @entity7 helped establish a small prayer room for @entity27 students at @entity31 . he also launched a book drive , shipping secondhand books to @entity2 to help teach @entity13 in his home country . and he was eventually hired at the @entity114 , and tasked with distributing @entity189 funds to 26 feeding programs across @entity127 . " he wanted to be involved in the frontline programs , " @entity143 said . " ultimately , it 's sad that all these things he came to see in terms of how you build a community , how you take responsibility for the life of a community , is at least in part what put him at odds with the authorities in @entity2 . " when he returned to @entity2 in 2004 after two and a half years in @entity20 , @entity7 set up an english - language school with friends . the school offered @entity13 lessons to young @entity2 at an affordable price -- a remarkable achievement in a society in which the government controls almost all facets of the economy . there is little tolerance for independent grassroots activism in @entity2 . the country has had the same authoritarian president , @entity218 , since it won independence from the @entity82 in 1991 . the @entity221 's recently published 2008 human rights report states " torture remain systemic in [ @entity2 's ] law enforcement ... human rights activists and journalists who criticized the government continued to be subjected to harassment , arbitrary arrest , politically motivated prosecution , forced psychiatric treatment and physical attack . " @entity2 security forces frequently target religious activists . " the government has almost a paranoia of any independent religious activity , particularly those related to @entity54 , " said @entity234 , a @entity169 expert at @entity235 . " the @entity2 government tries to control the religious sector very similar to the way the @entity82 did . they have a state @entity27 board that oversees what is proper islam - anything that falls out of that scope is seen as threatening and seditious . " the @entity2 government says it " views the ensuring of human rights and freedoms of its citizens as its highest priority . " a statement posted on the web site of the @entity61 in @entity62 cited the passage of more then 120 laws and 60 international treaties aimed at improving the country 's human rights record . the @entity2 government says it is making reforms of its judicial and penitentiary system , aimed at " prosecuting and punishing for the use of torture and other forms of ill - treatment . " @entity7 's former professors invited him to return on a scholarship to the @entity112 after his arrest , and two families offered to house @entity7 , his wife @entity272 and young son @entity271 . dr. @entity273 , @entity31 's academic vice president , hoped the graduate school offer would allow @entity2 authorities to release @entity7 . " it obviously did n't work , " he wrote in an e-mail to @entity0 . accounts of appalling conditions in @entity2 prisons have worried @entity7 's @entity112 friends , who remember how the slim @entity2 rode to barbecues on his bicycle , carrying a giant watermelon in a backpack as a gift . the hardest part has been trying to get information from @entity7 's family in @entity289 . " the government is tapping their phone and tracking their e-mail , " @entity137 said . " we 're pretty much sure neither of those is secure from the government . "
