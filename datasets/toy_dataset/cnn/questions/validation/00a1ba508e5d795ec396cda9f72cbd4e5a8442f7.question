" @entity7 traveled to @entity10 , @entity9 , on march 8 , 2007 , working on behalf of several large corporations , and his whereabouts , well - being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time , " it said in a statement . @entity6 secretary of state @entity25 issued a statement asking @entity9 to cooperate with the investigation into @entity7 's whereabouts . " he has spent more than 2,900 days separated from those who love him , and is one of the longest held @entity6 citizens in history . year after year , the family has endured the pain of his absence . it is time for him to come home , " @entity25 said . " we remain committed to the safe return of mr. @entity5 to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners . we remain concerned about mr. @entity5 's health given his age and the length of his disappearance . " @entity9 's government repeatedly has said it is not holding @entity7 and does not know his whereabouts . the @entity1 says he was in @entity9 as a private investigator . but news reports in 2013 said he was working as an independent @entity56 contractor when he disappeared . that prompted his family to speak out , saying they kept it quiet for years that @entity7 was working for the @entity56 , because the @entity6 government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy . the @entity1 , @entity64 and @entity56 have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the @entity56 and @entity7 . it 's unclear exactly who is holding him , but @entity6 officials have said they believe he is somewhere in southwest @entity71 . whoever his captors are , in 2010 they sent a " proof of life " videotape and photographs of @entity7 to his family . in the video , he asked the @entity6 government for help : " please help me get home , " a gaunt - looking @entity7 said on the tape , citing his 33 years of service in the @entity1 as a reason for that help . the photographs showed him with a large beard .
