( @entity1 ) the next time the people of @entity3 , @entity4 , hear the folks in @entity6 complain about a snow season of more than 100 inches , they 'll be like : " that 's nice . we 've been known to get that much in one day . " in 18 hours , actually . it 's not an official record yet , but it looks like the @entity4 village got 100.8 inches ( 256 centimeters ) on thursday , setting the all - time mark for most snow in 24 hours . @entity16 , about 21 miles ( 34.6 kilometers ) away , only got 94.5 inches ( 240 cm ) . that 's more than @entity6 got in january and february combined , but just short of the 105.7 inches the city totaled so far for the whole season . one of the photos posted on @entity21 , the @entity4 weather website that reported the immense snowfall , showed a resident standing on top of the accumulation shaking hands with a neighbor . she is in a second - story window . the town , which has about 1,000 residents and sits at an altitude of 4,662 feet ( 1,421 meters ) , is prone to heavy one - day snowfalls , @entity21 reported . you might conclude it 's in the @entity37 given all that snow , but that 's not the case . it 's about a three - hour drive east of @entity43 , roughly halfway down the @entity44 , not far from the @entity45 . but it is in the mountains and is vulnerable to weather coming from the northeast . the @entity50 will confirm whether the snowfall actually surpassed the 24 - hour snowfall record -- 75.8 inches -- from @entity53 , @entity54 , set in 1921 . @entity21 reported that the snow fell in 18 hours and that in unpopulated areas at higher altitudes , it is likely accumulations were much more significant . @entity1 meteorologists @entity60 and @entity61 contributed to this report .

the world record for 24 hours of snow is 75.8 inches , set in @placeholder in 1921
