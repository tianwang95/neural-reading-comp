@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) a coalition of @entity5 forces continued pounding rebel targets in @entity1 from the air on friday , the second day of a campaign aimed at the @entity10 group . while it was hard to immediately determine the extent of the damage and destruction , the resounding sounds of huge explosions heard around @entity0 on friday night suggested that the @entity18 - led strikes were taking a toll . the strikes ' target is @entity10 rebels , a @entity24 minority group that has taken over the capital and , on wednesday , captured key parts of the @entity1 port city of @entity28 . @entity28 was where president @entity29 had moved because of the rebel advance . @entity29 has since left @entity1 , and on friday he 'd arrived in @entity32 for a summit of @entity35 representatives . many nations in the @entity35 are now participating in the armed effort against the @entity10 and presumably to return @entity29 to @entity1 as its leader . while he 's not in @entity1 , the fierce fighting there continues . not surprisingly , the @entity10 are bearing the brunt of the bloodshed -- and not just in @entity0 . that includes at least 10 killed in the northwestern province of @entity47 , home to the @entity10 's leader @entity49 , @entity10 commanders said . more than a dozen more people were wounded , as 15 locations saw airstrikes . five @entity10 died were hurt in an attack by fighters loyal to @entity29 on a @entity10 post about 6 miles ( 10 kilometers ) outside @entity60 airbase , two security officials in @entity55 province said . that 's where @entity62 involved in fighting @entity63 had been based as recently as this month . @entity29 has also ordered the closure of all @entity10 - controlled media -- including @entity67 and @entity68 . the @entity10 , though , responded by raiding two tv channels and the prominent @entity71 newspaper . @entity75 's office in @entity0 was also targeted , with @entity10 looting security cameras and damaging equipment , the @entity73 - based network said . the nations stepping into @entity1 's civil war are predominantly @entity80 , and they are working to rescue a government that has strong @entity80 support . the @entity10 are allied with majority @entity83 . @entity18 , the largest contingent in the intervention dubbed @entity87 , considers the @entity10 to be proxies for the @entity24 government of @entity83 and fear another @entity24 - dominated state in the region . " what they do not want is an @entity96 - run state on their southern border , " @entity2 military analyst lt. col. @entity92 said of the @entity18 . the kingdom says @entity29 , who is out of the country , pleaded for military intervention in a letter . " i ask you , based on the principle of self - defense in @entity108 of the @entity109 , and on the basis of the @entity111 and the treaty of joint @entity114 defense , to provide instant support by all necessary means , including military intervention to protect @entity1 and its people from continuous @entity10 aggression , " read the letter , which was posted by @entity18 's @entity104 . @entity123 secretary of state @entity122 said thursday that the @entity123 commends the military action and is supporting it through intelligence sharing , targeting assistance and logistical support , a senior @entity121 official said . the other nations participating in the military action are the @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity73 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity32 , a @entity18 adviser has said . the adviser also included @entity137 , saying its military was offering naval support . but on friday , that country 's @entity141 said it had only vowed to defend @entity18 , according to a local media report . @entity18 and @entity32 have spoken about the possibility of sending ground troops . @entity18 has blockaded the @entity10 , effectively cutting off their supply lines . by thursday afternoon , the @entity18 controlled @entity1 airspace , the adviser said , and the military threatened to destroy any naval ships trying to enter @entity1 ports . supreme leader @entity49 spoke live thursday night in @entity1 on @entity153 , saying , " if any army tries to invade our country , we will prove that @entity1 will be a grave for those who invade us . " @entity83 denounced the military intervention . @entity160 , a spokeswoman for the country 's @entity104 , said the operation will throw an already complicated situation into further turmoil and disrupt chances at a peaceful resolution to @entity1 's months - long internal strife . it also wo n't help a region already facing terrorist threats from groups like @entity172 and @entity63 , she said . " this is a dangerous action against international responsibilities to respect countries ' national sovereignty , " @entity160 said , according to a report in @entity83 's state - run @entity174 . at least one major player in @entity1 besides the @entity10 -- the @entity180 , which is the party of longtime leader @entity181 -- thinks the @entity18 and their partners should stay out . the @entity180 says the airstrikes have already led to civilian casualties . the best way to stop the bloodshed is to bring everyone to the negotiating table , the group said . opinion : why @entity1 has come undone journalist @entity191 reported from @entity1 , and @entity2 's @entity193 and @entity194 wrote this story from @entity196 . @entity2 's @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 contributed to this report .
