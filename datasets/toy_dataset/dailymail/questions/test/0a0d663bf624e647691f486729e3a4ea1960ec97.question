@entity0 will try to take a leaf out of @entity3 's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the masters . @entity8 arrived at @entity9 having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the @entity13 , but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14 - under - par total which has only been bettered six times in @entity18 history . ' i 'm really excited about the rest of the year now . it 's a good momentum starter for me , ' said @entity8 , who was looking to become the first @entity23 player to win the @entity24 and @entity7 . @entity0 was unable to take victory at the masters , despite carding 14 - under - par for the tournament @entity8 believes that his finish of second at @entity9 can boost his season with some big events ahead @entity8 wants to follow the lead of @entity3 , who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 ' i tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about april to september when the big tournaments come around and that 's when i want to play well . ' you look at @entity3 's year last year , it was all about how he played in the summer ( winning the @entity24 , @entity38 and @entity39 @entity13 in the space of four weeks ) . i was trying to keep telling myself it 's a long year . very happy it turned around this week in a major championship . ' the thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that i have not been in contention and i have n't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw . ' i was really pleased at how comfortable i felt in that situation , last group in the masters on sunday . i think that 's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon . ' @entity8 began the final round four shots behind @entity58 and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine , but was never able to get any closer . ' there 's two ways to look at it . you can think that 14 under par , i 'll take that next year and i 'll take that the year after and i 'll take it the year after , so i have to take a lot of confidence from that , ' he added . @entity8 had struggled to hit top form going into the masters but now hopes to sustain his @entity9 form @entity8 ( left ) congratulates tournament winner @entity58 and praised his performance level for the week ' but you 've got to play it on the day , too . i felt like there were a few moments out there where i could have done better and i 'll learn on that and think about that . ' @entity82 did n't really open the door and i did n't really expect him to . really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole . i felt that if i make my birdie putt and @entity82 misses for par , it 's a two - shot swing and i 'm two back with two to play . but my putt just slid by and he made a great eight - footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day , really .

@placeholder hopes to build on his display and take some big titles across the year
