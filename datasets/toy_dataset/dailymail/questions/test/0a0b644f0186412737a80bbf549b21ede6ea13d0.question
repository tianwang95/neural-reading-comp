@entity0 has been the best player in the @entity1 all season and on saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to @entity5 ’s imminent title victory . he is now the player you look to in a crisis . he is the man who has been eking out wins when the team has n’t been at its best . he did it last week at @entity12 , winning the ball from the goalkeeper ’s kick and driving into the box to set up @entity17 , and he did it on saturday with his finish . he ’s dragging them over the line at the minute . you wondered when @entity23 came in whether @entity0 would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him . and he would have taken the hint when he saw @entity28 moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players . @entity0 fires past @entity33 following a storming run from the @entity36 star into the box hazard celebrates in front of the @entity41 faithful following his 38th minute strike the @entity5 forward 's first - half strike proved crucial as the @entity45 eked out a 1 - 0 victory he perhaps looked at that and responded . you will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today , not against the best teams . then he is required to do the requisite defensive work . and he does now . but the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on saturday . he ’s now on 17 goals for the season . he ’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals . he is the danger man , he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team . he ’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he ’s creeping ever closer . what he will need to reach that level is for @entity5 to make a @entity72 final and for him to be decisive . hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the @entity76 goal as @entity77 tries to snuff out the danger he is improving every season , which is a good sign , and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good . @entity5 will win the league now . i do n’t think they ’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time . it ’s about surviving the difficult periods — and @entity5 have n’t lost games when they ’ve struggled in the same way that @entity91 or @entity76 did . now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and @entity23 would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give @entity95 or @entity17 a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate . as for @entity76 , for all their dominance in possession , they lacked enough clear - cut chances . in fact they needed something like the magic of @entity104 ’s back - heel and @entity0 ’s finish . @entity106 will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch . @entity113 takes on @entity95 , @entity17 and @entity0 at @entity41 with @entity113 not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries , it did neuter them somewhat . i thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent . but he ’s been the thrust of the team in recent times . maybe two years ago @entity125 or @entity126 could have provided that , but at the moment @entity76 need @entity113 to give them that impetus in the really difficult games . when sir @entity130 left , you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation . it ’s been a bumpy ride and they would n’t have expected another change of manager , but at least , two years on , it looks as though they are now in that place . @entity23 may look to give key players such as @entity17 ( right ) a rest in the coming weeks

he has eked out wins for @placeholder when they have not been at their best
