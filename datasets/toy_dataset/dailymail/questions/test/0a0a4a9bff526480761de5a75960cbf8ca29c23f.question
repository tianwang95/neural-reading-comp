' that 's kind of what we 're talking about right now , just football . ' if charges are brought with regard to the incident in @entity16 , @entity10 could face discipline under the @entity1 's personal conduct policy and a suspension seems possible given his history . @entity10 was investigated after an alleged assault on a @entity154 cab driver and resisted arrest on a battery charge sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .
