when @entity2 's first husband walked out on her and their three young boys without a moment 's notice , she thought her life was over . with not a single penny in her bank and three hungry boys to feed , @entity2 was left begging for food , living off food stamps and home was their car . but now 22 years after the day her life fell apart , @entity2 , 59 , is living the life of her dreams and it 's all down to 61 - year - old @entity18 . for when the tv mogul 's career began , @entity2 today reveals how an uncanny resemblance to the hottest new celebrity in town brought her happiness beyond her wildest dreams . scroll down for video dead ringer : @entity2 ( right ) reveals how an uncanny resemblance to the hottest celebrity in town brought her happiness beyond her wildest dreams after she was unceremoniously dumped by her first husband open arms : today @entity2 is paid to appear as @entity18 at anything from 90th birthday parties and corporate events . she also makes unpaid appearances at woman 's shelters ' she is such an amazing woman , ' says @entity2 . ' who channeled such positivity despite where she came from ' soul sisters : @entity2 ( right as a child ) believes that @entity18 ( left in her high school yearbook ) saved her life . ' there was a time when i was so low and helpless i questioned whether i could go on ' after constantly being told she was the dead ringer for @entity18 , @entity2 entered a look - a - like competition and has never looked back . today she is one of the most sought after celebrity look - a - likes in the business and thanks to her newfound career has given her now grown - up sons @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , the life she feared they would never have . not only has being @entity18 allowed her to pay the boys ' through college , channeling her image has given @entity2 the confidence she never had . ' @entity18 literally has saved my life , ' tells @entity2 . ' there was a time when i was so low and helpless i questioned whether i could go on . ' i was so low i was even hospitalized for 30 days due to malnutrition and depression . ' but now i live and breathe the positivity that @entity18 tells us all to channel . ' thanks to her i am happy , have married my dream man , have put a home over my families heads and am making a living out of making people smile . ' it was back in 1992 while living in @entity83 with her ex-husband @entity84 , that @entity2 's life fell apart . @entity2 , here with her mom , was struggling to provide for her children after her husband walked out of their lives until she entered an @entity18 lookalike contest while working for the military , @entity84 simply left the house that morning and never came back . recalling that dark time in her life , @entity2 said : ' he walked out that day and said " see you later honey , i 'm going to work , " kissed me on the cheek and headed out of the house . ' but he did n't just leave for work , he walked out of the home and our lives forever . ' we had been married for seventeen years , i can honestly say i had no inkling . ' one minute he was here the next he was n't . ' worse still @entity2 tells how when she went to the bank , she found their account was empty . @entity2 said : ' i did n't even have a dime to buy the boys food . ' it is hard to put into words what that feels @entity115 feel like your entire world has fallen apart . ' i was not close to my family and i felt like i had nowhere to turn . ' one day out of sheer desperation i even sold my wedding ring and used the money to buy a gallon of milk , a loaf of bread and some gas for the car . ' it got so bad , i had no option but to live with the kids in our @entity131 . ' and that was our life for two months . ' @entity135 recalling that dark time in her life , @entity2 said : ' he walked out that day and said : " see you later honey , i 'm going to work , " kissed me on the cheek and headed out of the house . but he did n't just leave for work , he walked out of the home and our lives forever . ' a relative in @entity149 eventually offered a helping hand to @entity2 and after moving there , it was then , people began telling her she bore an uncanny resemblance to @entity18 . @entity2 said : ' the first time it happened i laughed it off and said " how can little old me look like someone as amazing as @entity18 ? " ' but then it began to happen more and more . ' and the more i looked in the mirror at myself , the more i began to realize we were so alike it was almost spooky . ' it 's not just our faces either , it 's our mannerisms , our hands and our lives seemed to mirror each other . ' it was almost as if we were twins , two gloves that were entwined with each other . ' just like me @entity18 had endured a difficult childhood and just like me @entity18 struggled with her weight . ' she even seemed to change her hairstyle at exactly the same i would change mine . ' we were living parallel lives and i loved her from the moment i saw her on the screen . ' she is such an amazing woman , who channeled such positivity despite where she came from . ' eventually a friend persuaded @entity2 to enter a look - alike show on @entity183 in 2007 and despite not winning , her new career was born . today @entity2 is paid to appear as @entity18 at anything from 90 - year - old birthday parties to corporate events . she makes unpaid appearances at woman 's shelters . @entity2 , who is now married to second husband @entity191 , 60 , said : ' i 'll never forget the day i was paid to appear at a corporate event and surprise the guests by giving away an @entity194 to ever single one of them . ' i did it exactly like the time when @entity18 caused a frenzy by giving everyone in the audience a car . ' i said : " you get an @entity194 and you get an @entity194 and you get an @entity194 " and the room was jumping . it was so much fun . ' but equally rewarding is the charity appearances i do , when just like @entity18 i try to talk to women about channeling positivity and turning your life around . ' because i am living proof , that dreams do happen , you just have to believe it . ' the more i looked in the mirror at myself , the more i began to realize we were so alike it was almost spooky ' ' some days i just gasp when i look up into the mirror and say ' well hello miss @entity18 ' and laugh to myself ' ' i just hope one day i get to meet @entity18 so i can tell her face to face just how much she has done for me , without even realizing it . ' as she walks , talks and moves her hands everything about @entity2 exudes @entity18 and it is not surprising she can not even go to the grocery store without people stopping and asking her for her autograph . ' it 's hard to go out for a coffee these days as now i have perfected my @entity18 look so much , i think half the time i think i am her , ' laughs @entity2 . ' people are always stopping me asking if they can help me with my bags , have my autograph and enquiring how @entity231 is and no matter how much i insist i am just a look - a - like they just laugh and say , ' that 's what all the celebrities say to have a quiet life . '' although @entity2 herself admits she looks so like her idol @entity18 that she even shocks herself some mornings when she looks in the mirror . ' i think when you have spent so many hours perfecting her mannerisms , her make - up and her look , then you do start to feel like that person , ' tells @entity2 . ' some days i just gasp when i look up into the mirror and say ' well hello miss @entity18 ' and laugh to myself . '

at one appearance she gave away @entity194 like @entity18 's famous car giveaways saying : ' you get an @entity194 and you get an @placeholder and you get an @entity194 . '
