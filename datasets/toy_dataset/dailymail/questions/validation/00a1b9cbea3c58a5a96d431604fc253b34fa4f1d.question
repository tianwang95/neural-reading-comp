a ring crafted more than 1,000 years ago confirms highlights the contact between the @entity3 and the @entity5 world . discovered inside a ninth century woman ’s grave in @entity10 , the stone inset into the ring bears an inscription that says ‘ for @entity12 ’ or ‘ to @entity12 ’ . while it is already known that the @entity3 acquired glass in far flung lands , the artefact bolsters the theory that the seafaring civilisation did business with @entity5 traders . a ring ( pictured ) made over 1,000 years ago has confirmed contact between the @entity3 and the @entity5 world because it was unearthed in @entity10 but bears an ancient @entity23 inscription that asys ' for @entity12 ' or ' to @entity12 ' the ring was discovered during excavations of a @entity28 trading centre in @entity29 , @entity10 , in the late 1800s , @entity24 reported . since then , it has been thought that stone in the ring is violet amethyst , but now experts have revealed it is coloured glass – an exotic material at the time . researchers at @entity40 used a scanning electron microscope to determine the material and to clearly reveal ancient @entity23 writing called @entity45 writing , that reads ‘ for @entity12 or ‘ to @entity12 . ’ it is known that @entity47 traded glass objects from @entity49 and @entity50 up to 3,400 years ago , so it is entirely possible that the @entity3 fetched glass goods from the region instead of waiting for them to make their way north via trade networks . ancient texts also mention trades taking place between the @entity3 and members of the @entity5 civilisation , which stretched from the @entity61 to @entity62 , but archaeological evidence is rare . the ring was discovered during excavations of a @entity28 trading centre in @entity29 , @entity10 ( shown by the red marker ) which lies west of @entity67 , in the late 1800s but has now been examined under a scanning electron microscope to determine the stone is exotic glass , rather than an amythest ancient texts mention trades taking place between the @entity3 and members of the @entity5 civilisation , which stretched from the @entity61 to @entity62 , but archaeological evidence is rare . an illustration of @entity3 unloading goods from a longboat is shown the study , published in the journal @entity79 , says : ‘ the ring may … constitute material evidence for direct interactions between @entity83 and the @entity5 world . ‘ being the only ring with an @entity23 inscription found at a @entity47 archaeological site , it is a unique object among @entity90 material . ’ further analysis of the ring showed that it was rarely worn . the inner ring still shows signs of where the silver was filed by a craftsman , meaning that it was probably sold as new before it became a treasured possession of a @entity28 woman . ‘ the ring has been cast in a high - grade silver alloy ( 94.5/5.5 ag / cu ) and retains the post-casting marks from the filing done to remove flash and mould lines , ’ according to the study . ‘ thus , the ring has rarely been worn , and likely passed from the silversmith to the woman buried at @entity29 with few owners in between . ’ last year , a @entity28 sword was discovered in a field in @entity113 by aman scanning the area with a metal detector . this led experts from the @entity119 at the @entity120 to excavate the site . they found a grave dating to @entity123 that contained the remains of a shield buried with a @entity28 warrior , as well as a sword bearing an inscription . the boss from a @entity28 shield ( pictured ) was recently found to contain @entity5 coins in a leather purse . this evidence strengthens the theory that the @entity3 traded with @entity5 civilisations , or came into contact with the culture in @entity138 incredibly , the shield boss - the round part at the centre of a shield - concealed a leather purse with @entity5 coins inside . this evidence strengthens the theory that the @entity3 traded with @entity5 civilisations , or came into contact with the culture in @entity138 . archaeologist @entity145 told @entity146 : ‘ we have not managed to find out who owned the sword , but we know that he was a well - travelled man . ’ ‘ the shield boss has a clear cut mark by an axe or a sword , ’ she said , before adding that it is not known if the man died in battle .
