astronomers have been left baffled by the rise and subsequent fall of a huge feature in a sea on @entity6 ’s @entity5 . in july 2012 a giant feature 100 square miles ( 260 square kilometres ) in area - roughly the area of 58,000 football fields - is seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again . no definitive explanation is yet apparent but it could be a surface wave , rising bubbles or even a solid object just below the surface . in this series of images from the @entity20 spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles ( 260 square kilometres ) in size is seen rising out of one of @entity5 's largest seas before disappearing again . in the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface the feature was spotted by @entity29 ’s @entity20 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around the @entity6 system . it was spotted in @entity33 , one of the largest seas on @entity5 , and was observed by @entity20 ’s radar experiment . in images from 10 july 2012 to 21 august 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface . with its thick atmosphere and organic - rich chemistry , @entity5 resembles a frozen version of @entity43 several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere . because @entity5 is smaller than @entity43 , its gravity does n’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles ( 595 kilometres ) into space . as on @entity43 , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on @entity5 are about seven @entity43 years long . @entity5 's ‘ water ’ is liquid methane , @entity59 , better known on @entity43 as natural gas . regular @entity43 - water , @entity63 , would be frozen solid on @entity5 where the surface temperature is @entity65 ( -292 ° f ) . with @entity5 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as @entity43 's raindrops . as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes . but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades . a comparison image from 26 april 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region . the mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images , suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image . this supports one theory that it may be a solid structure - potentially an island - that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason . the dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on @entity5 ’s surface , while the bright area is land . scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data . they have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation , as the nearby shoreline has not changed much . several theories currently exist including surface waves , rising bubbles , floating solids , solids suspended just below the surface or ‘ something more exotic ’ according to @entity29 . when asked for further comment by @entity113 the agency was yet to respond . speaking to @entity114 from the @entity115 , who also works on the @entity20 mission , said it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on @entity43 . ‘ it could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface , ’ she says . ‘ i was thinking almost like an iceberg , similar to something in @entity43 ’s oceans . ’ but she does n’t rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble , or even surface waves . she goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at @entity6 . the first image in 2007 was taken ‘ around @entity6 equinox [ when the sun is above the equator ] , and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on @entity6 . ‘ that ’s sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the @entity20 results ; a lot of things depend on the season at @entity6 as it moves in orbit . ‘ because this lake itself is actually near to @entity5 ’s northern pole , perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions . ' a comparison image from 26 april 2007 ( left ) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region . the feature was spotted by @entity29 ’s @entity20 spacecraft , which is currently in orbit around the @entity6 system . on the right is an image of @entity5 in orbit around @entity6 the feature was spotted in @entity33 ( shown ) , one of the largest seas on @entity5 , and was observed by @entity20 ’s radar experiment . several theories currently exist including surface waves , rising bubbles , floating solids , solids suspended just below the surface or ‘ something more exotic ’ according to @entity29 the appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on @entity5 , with summer drawing near in the moon ’s northern hemisphere . monitoring these changes is a major goal of @entity20 ’s current extended mission . ‘ science loves a mystery , and with this enigmatic feature , we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on @entity5 , ’ said dr @entity182 , the deputy team lead of @entity20 's radar team , based at @entity29 ’s @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187 . ‘ we 're hopeful that we 'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what 's going on in that alien sea . ’ it 's not just @entity5 that is thought to have an active surface ; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than @entity204 . experts from the @entity206 and the @entity207 , @entity208 , say @entity204 could be more @entity43 - like than experts imagined . the latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists . it shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding . many parts of @entity204 ’s surface show evidence of extension , where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart , and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap , a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading , according to the study published in the journal @entity229 . @entity204 ’s surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old , which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics . it has been a decade since @entity20 entered orbit around @entity6 ( illustration shown ) . in june the @entity20 mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet , its rings and moons . it arrived for a four - year mission but has since been continuously extended , although it will almost certainly end in 2017
