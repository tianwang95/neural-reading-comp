last week scientists at @entity1 claimed to have come up with the perfect formula for stacking a dishwasher . but rather than causing cheers all round , it has intensified the bitter arguments that rage every day among the millions of dishwasher - owning households nationwide . so who are the best dishwasher stackers ? husbands — or wives ? @entity14 and @entity15 ( pictured ) like many couples , have long battled over the best way to stack a dishwasher @entity14 and @entity15 , who have been locked in a dishwasher war for most of their 12 - year marriage , invited @entity22 , dishwasher expert at retailer @entity24 , into their home to settle the argument once and for all . @entity14 says : early evening , and peace has descended . the children have been fed and watered and the house is ( reasonably ) clean . i ’m about to settle into the sofa with a well - deserved glass of wine when i hear bad - tempered clattering in the kitchen . i peer around the door and see @entity15 , crouching in a cloud of steam , hastily rearranging the contents of the dishwasher mid-cycle . he just can not help himself . convinced of his dishwasher - stacking superiority , he can not bear to leave this most vital domestic task in my — in his opinion — incapable hands . @entity14 and @entity15 put their differing techniques to the test under the watchful eye of @entity22 a dishwasher expert at @entity24 @entity15 clearly is not alone . those @entity1 scientists actually published a research paper on dishwasher stacking . they solemnly tracked water movement inside the machine , deciding what should be put where — in relation to the position of water jets and dirtiness of the crockery — to come up with the perfect formula . i ’m afraid i read this report and snorted ; just as i do when @entity15 nitpicks over the placing of plates and bowls when he could be enjoying a glass of wine on the sofa with me . it ’s a machine for washing up . just chuck your dishes in , i say . every day after breakfast i throw cereal bowls , spoons , milk pan and toast plates willy - nilly into our ten - year - old @entity80 and leave it to do its stuff . @entity14 takes the view that it 's a machine for washing up and therefore everything that goes in will somehow end up getting clean in my opinion , all the dishes will get clean somehow . the worst case scenario is that i end up hand - washing a few less - than - perfect items afterwards . really , what ’s the problem ? but when i return from the school run , invariably i find that a scientifically - minded pixie has popped in for a visit . that ’s a male pixie in his mid- 40s , wearing a cardigan and harrumphing as he rearranges the dishwasher to his own satisfaction . @entity102 is rinsed , glasses arranged in height size and all the cutlery is facing upwards . this same pixie has also taken out anything heavily soiled ‘ to hand wash ’ . i ’m afraid @entity15 thinks i am a slattern and i think he is an insane perfectionist . some of the bitterest words of our marriage have been spoken over a box of finish dishwasher tablets . @entity22 ( left ) was visibly horrified by the way @entity14 ( right ) was stacking the dishwasher but now scientists are on the case , i realise there may be more to dishwasher stacking than i thought . although they vary widely in price and size , dishwashers all work on the same principle : water in the bottom of the appliance heats up , then two rotating spray arms — one under the lower rack and one under the upper one — spray the water at the dishes . currently , around 30 per cent of us own a dishwasher — which horrifies me . how do the rest cope ? i always thought it was as vital to a kitchen as pots and pans . @entity14 values speed over efficiency when dealing with the dishes , whereas @entity15 takes a more methodical approach and dishwasher wars are rife : 42 per cent of people surveyed last september admitted they had reloaded the dishwasher after their family had gone to bed because they thought it was done incorrectly . and there is the entirely reasonable sounding statistic that 79 per cent had put a load through again just to save the bother of unloading the dishwasher . guilty as charged , @entity156 . @entity15 , in a tragic attempt to impose order on a chaotic world ( or rather , his chaotic wife ) once talked me through his method . it did not end well . i still could not see why his method was better than any other . for our test together , i coated a number of plates with egg , lasagne , @entity170 and baked beans , swilled milk and red wine around glasses , and filled cups with coffee then tipped it away . i gave @entity15 and myself an identical number of dishes to stack , then we put them through the same 45 - minute cycle . @entity22 actually looks sad as she watches me throwing everything in . as far as i ’m concerned it ’s all about speed — and nothing else . i stuff the cutlery into the basket , not caring whether it ’s handle - end or blade - end facing down . plates are put in any spare slot , and i do n’t care whether serving dishes go on the bottom rack or the top . glasses and mugs are also placed wherever i can see a space . poor thing . @entity22 has devoted her life to appliances and here i am , abusing one . i actually see her wince at one point of the process and begin to wonder if i should be giving the whole thing more thought . yet the job is done in minutes . the door is slammed shut and the reassuring sound of churning water fills the kitchen . i still can not imagine how the end result would differ from anyone else ’s . @entity22 's verdict : the only good thing i can say about @entity14 ’s stacking is that it ’s fast . otherwise , it ’s a disaster . she has put the lasagne pan on top , taking up masses of space . it ’s further from the powerful jets of water at the bottom and so is unlikely to get clean . @entity22 ( pictured ) said : ' the only good thing i can say about @entity14 ’s stacking is that it ’s fast . otherwise , it ’s a disaster ' all the cutlery is facing downwards , where the water ca n’t get to the business end as easily and she ’s barely scraped the dishes . the glasses at the bottom are more likely to get damaged because they ’re more likely to get knocked over by the powerful bottom jets . most of it is filthy when the wash is finished and i am particularly disgusted by the glass of water which she shoved in upside down and which ended up full of cloudy water and old baked beans . a total dishwashing fail . time taken : two minutes stacking : 4/10 cleanliness : 3/10 @entity15 says : when i read the @entity1 paper , it resonated with good sense . lead researcher dr @entity251 , suggested packing the dishes according to the type of stain they demonstrate . so potato and tomato need as much force as possible from the water jets . proteins such as egg yolk need more chemical detergent . in our household , where i am the only person with the ability to stack a dishwasher , this , sadly , will never happen . @entity15 ( pictured ) has taken note of the work done by researcher dr @entity251 , who suggests stacking disghes according to the stains they demonstrate one of my daily chores , as necessary as the dog walking and school run , is re-stacking the dishwasher . at least twice . if @entity14 turns it on before i catch her , i often have to pull it open at the end of a cycle , look despairingly inside and put it on again because not one of the plates or cups is clean . my approach is — i believe — obvious , straightforward and logical . i rinse dirty food from plates before putting them in . cutlery faces upwards and the more tidily it is lined up , why , the more likely it is to get clean . anything which is too dirty is washed by hand . @entity15 , pictured with @entity22 , has a logical approach which involves rinsing the worst affected dishes and stacking cutlery upright i wonder whether the oft - quoted idea that men have superior spatial awareness skills , and a natural leaning towards creating ‘ systems ’ , such as filing and rotas , may be why i am so much better than this than @entity14 . there ’s also an argument that testosterone helps us achieve dominance in whatever goal we set ourselves . perhaps my determination to stack the dishwasher correctly makes it a success . ( though i ca n’t help thinking it ’s a bit of a waste of my testosterone ) . there is clearly never going to be any resolution of the argument in our house , as each of us is convinced they are right . realistically , neither of us is prepared to concede any ground . so , i was happy to hand the argument over to an expert , in a bid to prove that my way is right . @entity22 ’s verdict : every single item emerged sparkling and clean . @entity15 ’s method is beautifully orderly . all the mug handles are pointing in the same direction , so you can just pull them out together and put them away quickly . @entity15 ( pictured ) scored a massive 9.5/10 for his stacking abilities and 9/10 for cleanliness , losing marks only for putting the detergent in the cutlery basket the same size plates are carefully stacked together and pans and heavy objects are on the bottom — nearer to both the detergent and the jets of water . everything is placed at a careful angle so all the water runs off . i removed half a point from @entity15 ’s score , but only because he put the detergent in the cutlery basket . for optimal cleaning the detergent should only be released when the water is at the right temperature . but otherwise this is brilliant . almost professional . time taken : six minutes marks for stacking : @entity367 marks for cleanliness : 9/10 @entity15 ’s reaction : i suspect that the smug look on my face is unbearable . i am grinning and holding up two shiny clean plates i ’ve pulled from our dishwasher . i am clearly the overall winner of the decade long @entity377 in the @entity15 household . @entity14 ’s reaction : ok , so some of the plates came out a little grubby . so what ? now @entity15 ’s superiority has been confirmed , i am happy to hand over the task in its entirety to him . i hope he and the dishwasher are very happy together .
