unbeatable , unbreakable , perhaps even unstoppable . whatever mix of mojo and moxie @entity2 have working for them this season , it ’s clearly effective . and maybe just a little bit supernatural . @entity8 ’s stupendous strike to secure a dramatic late draw from sunday 's @entity10 at @entity11 certainly looked to have a touch of the magical about it . his 35 - yard belt — into a two - club headwind , mind — dipped drastically to crash in off the underside of the bar at the last moment . @entity21 's players celebrate taking the lead against @entity2 thanks to a goal from striker @entity25 @entity26 of @entity2 was shown a red card for this challenge on @entity29 goalscorer @entity25 but @entity8 ( above ) rescued a point for @entity2 with a late long range strike in a dramatic ending one of the best goals ever scored in this fixture , the unexpected injury - time intervention earned 10 - man @entity2 a reprieve from a game that @entity29 should have won . if that sounds like a familiar scenario to anyone with even a passing interest in this rivalry , the home side are absolved of any great blame for the loss of two points here . sure , they might have killed this game off when 1 - 0 up against a side reduced in numbers by @entity26 ’s deserved red card . ahead through a @entity25 goal just before half - time , they created chances to bury @entity2 . but one of the great strengths of the visitors , who extended their unbeaten start to this season to 11 games , has been in finding a way — however unlikely — to take something when nothing appears likely . on this occasion , a @entity70 - born @entity69 centre - half ’s unstoppable thunderbolt from the stratosphere saw them move one point further clear at the top of the table . a side - effect of a moment that created absolute bedlam in the away end , as @entity2 supporters — who had filled their allocation — revelled in the glory of another enjoyable derby day . @entity85 's ( above ) @entity2 side are unbeaten and six points clear atop the @entity87 @entity89 ' ( above ) @entity21 team are 14 points behind rivals and leaders @entity2 after today 's draw ‘ @entity99 . if not now , when ? ’ demanded the bill posters stuck to lamp posts the length of @entity11 by @entity29 activists for this match day . although their @entity101 is aimed at rallying supporters in protest against the club ’s board , the words might easily have been applied to the position of the team . starting the day outside of the top four , a daunting 14 points adrift of the visiting leaders , @entity89 ’ men surely had to eke out more than just a draw from this second derby of the season . the comeback had to start here . they certainly looked like the more adept footballing side from the outset , with midfielders @entity118 and @entity120 excelling in a diamond formation . they appeared to have enough guile to create openings , even if @entity25 and @entity125 seemed determined to pass up chances to score . perhaps predictably on a day of gusting gales , the two best early chances came as a result of mistakes , @entity25 flicking the ball wide after @entity132 had dawdled , then been robbed by @entity125 , while @entity133 shot straight at keeper @entity134 after @entity29 defender @entity135 had allowed the ball to bounce over his head . @entity139 manager @entity138 ( top left ) was watching title rivals @entity2 in action against @entity21 @entity141 of @entity2 ( left ) tries to protect the ball from @entity143 ( right ) of @entity21 proceedings were predictably error - strewn , although @entity145 for @entity2 and home midfielder @entity120 looked capable of bringing a touch of composure to play , while @entity29 also boasted one of the more clever players in @entity118 . the opener came from an @entity118 corner one minute before half - time , @entity154 - born @entity153 striker @entity25 eventually firing the ball into the roof of the net after @entity159 and @entity125 had both seen efforts blocked . remarkably , this was the first time @entity2 had trailed in a league game all season . now we would find out something about the men who had begun to make this @entity87 lark look so easy . they did not quite assert themselves with aplomb after the break , the tempo and direct running of @entity29 continuing to unsettle the visitors . indeed , @entity25 came close to making it 2 - 0 early in the second half , flashing his header from an @entity178 just wide . @entity118 himself did wonderfully to shrug aside @entity186 and tear towards the box moments later , the @entity2 man clipping his opponent ’s heels inches outside the box to concede a free - kick that , half a breath later , would have been a penalty . even as @entity29 were flying in the final third , though , their own penalty area resembled a panic - stricken war zone . cross after cross seemed capable of undoing all their good work , the ball being allowed to bounce far too often . @entity25 celebrates putting @entity21 into the lead in the first half with a close range strike on 44 minutes the introduction of @entity202 added something to @entity2 , the winger taking just seconds to get into the fray , drilling a low cross through the legs of @entity208 and forcing @entity134 to do well to deny @entity26 . the loss of skipper @entity132 to injury soon after did n’t seem to disrupt @entity2 too greatly , @entity186 coming close to an equaliser as he stormed into the box and clipped a right - footed effort just past the far post . when @entity26 was then rightly red - carded for a wild , desperate , high , cynical and undoubtedly dangerous challenge on the fast - breaking @entity25 after 78 minutes , though , even the most optimistic of @entity2 fans must have feared the worst ; they ended the game with a back three of @entity186 , @entity145 and @entity8 . @entity125 missed another good chance , this time with a header , to seal a @entity29 victory . the suspicion lingered that , somehow , something would happen to punish the home team . @entity8 's brilliant effort in the last moments , which went in off the underside of the bar , brought @entity2 level @entity230 's goal was celebrated wildly by the @entity2 fans who had made the short journey to @entity232 @entity233 , a player whose longest of long - rangers would have been accompanied by cut - off cries of indignant protest from @entity2 fans , management and team - mates — possibly even members of his own family — wondering what on earth he was doing , chancing his luck from that distance ... oh , right . @entity247 ! it is telling that , while the boiling mass of maroon in the away end , prompted by the goal , was still in full eruption long after the final whistle , @entity29 were actually applauded off the park , the home crowd recognising their contribution to a day of high drama . the @entity21 are vastly improved from the team who surrendered their @entity264 place so meekly and , all things being equal , they should certainly feature in the promotion race . @entity2 ? still leading . still setting a blistering pace . still carrying with them an air of invincibility that is beginning to get almost spooky .

striker @placeholder had given @entity21 a first half advantage
