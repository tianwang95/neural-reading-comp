as one might imagine , @entity1 's arrival at @entity2 as interim manager in 2012 came as quite a slap in the face to @entity7 fans still hurting from @entity9 's untimely departure just months after winning the @entity10 . this was a man who had beaten the @entity13 in two @entity10 semi-finals with drab defensive tactics - meaning that a sub-standard @entity17 side reached two finals , while @entity20 's team of world class individuals missed out . as expected , we did n't warm to @entity1 when he walked out for his first game at @entity24 . he had made a number of derogatory comments about the club during his @entity17 days and was rightly given a frosty reception . @entity1 is set to leave @entity29 this summer and will have a host of clubs after his services @entity1 was made @entity7 interim manager in 2012 but it 's fair to say the fans never warmed to him @entity36 is a fan writer on 90min.com he did little to bring the support on - side in his the first few weeks either . @entity7 drew @entity1 's first two games 0 - 0 , before a 3 - 1 defeat against @entity41 in a @entity43 derby - embarrassing . the only thing is , in the end he managed to get the job done and it would be the same for another club today . @entity1 never liked being called the ' interim ' manager , in fact he made a point of letting people know the title irked him , but he was brought in on a mission to keep the club on course until the end of the season . it was n't pretty , but that was exactly what he did . @entity1 also managed to get a better return from @entity63 - a player that was pretty much useless at @entity7 before and after . the season even ended with another @entity67 trophy . people often forget that in 2011/12 @entity7 finished 6th in the @entity69 - the lowest in 10 years - a fact conveniently masked by two cup wins . in 2012/13 @entity1 ensured @entity7 finished 3rd and got an automatic pass back into the @entity10 group stage when there was big pressure from @entity76 and @entity77 . as @entity7 fans , we certainly did n't like him , but looking back we hate to think what might have happened without him . @entity1 got the best out of his squad for the rest of the season and he got the best out of @entity63 @entity7 won the @entity86 in 2013 under @entity1 after beating @entity87 in @entity88 one @entity7 fan thanks @entity1 for his efforts on the last day of the season in 2013 at @entity2 the rumours are that he could now be on for a return to the @entity69 - he knows @entity94 football inside out and would actually be perfect for several clubs . @entity96 is one possible destination - he 'd probably do a similar interim job there while they wait for @entity100 - and @entity101 is another . the reality is that while @entity1 possibly would n't be a popular choice at either , he would give both clubs exactly what they need . city require an experienced and pragmatic stop - gap that knows how to keep things ticking over until they can land their superstar . @entity101 need someone who can get the best out of a talented group of players that are significantly underachieving at this moment in time . in that respect @entity1 certainly made sure @entity17 punched above their weight . people do n't like to admit it , but he 's a good manager and probably deserves his chance in the @entity69 again .
