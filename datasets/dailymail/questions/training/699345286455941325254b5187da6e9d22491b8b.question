vice president @entity0 has been a non-factor in the debt and budget fight so far . the last news wire photos of him came ten days ago , and he has n't made any public statements about the standoff that has gripped @entity7 if @entity9 were bluffing over @entity10 and the debt ceiling , it 's now the @entity13 ' turn to play high - stakes poker . and the notoriously gaffe - prone @entity0 has been called back from his @entity16 vacation to put the screws on the @entity9 . the @entity18 issued a statement on monday saying that @entity20 would remind congressional leaders in the @entity22 at 3:00 p.m. that he ' will not pay a ransom for @entity24 reopening the government and raising the debt limit . ' that meeting was postponed about 20 minutes before it was scheduled to begin . the @entity18 released a statement saying the action was taken ' to allow leaders in the @entity32 time to continue making important progress towards a solution that raises the debt limit and reopens the government . some observers are saying the hastily scheduled meeting will be a session of liars ' poker whose stakes are half fiscal and half political . ' this whole shutdown has been completely unnecessary , ' @entity20 told reporters during an unscheduled stop monday afternoon at a @entity7 , @entity46 soup kitchen , complaining that '' we 've seen this brinksmanship time and time again to try and extract extreme partisan concessions . ' @entity13 had succeeded in pushing republicans off of their earlier bluff in which they threatened to keep the government closed and risk a debt default unless the president accepted significant changes to the @entity10 law . now the political left is demanding its own concessions , including a long - term extension of the debt ceiling that would push off the next fiscal precipice until after the 2014 midterm elections . putting meat in the sandwich : @entity20 was due to meet party leaders at the @entity18 in a bid to finally resolve the deadlock after spending the morning at a @entity46 foodbank hard to swallow : republicans will be angered by the bold demand from the @entity13 after @entity20 has for the last month said he would not pay a ' ransom ' @entity13 are also insisting that when the government reopens , it must be a short - term fix . they want a chance to revisit the budget and increase federal spending , according to a senior @entity13 @entity18 aide . ' the @entity9 are cutting the budget to the bone , ' the staffer said on monday . ' we 're not going to jeopardize @entity84 funding or @entity85 because the @entity9 wants to please its radical tea party base . ' but @entity9 counter that @entity88 , the @entity13 ' leader in the @entity32 , would balloon government spending far beyond what both houses of @entity24 agreed to in 2011 , and even further past what the january sequester agreement permits . sen. @entity94 told @entity95 on monday that @entity88 wants to see the federal government spending ' a million dollars a minute for the next year . ' @entity88 has told reporters that he hopes to arrive in the @entity22 with a deal proposal in hand . in addition to the long - term debt limit hike and the short - term leash to reopen the government , it will provide a delay – not a repeal – of an unpopular @entity10 - related medical device tax . @entity13 are also reportedly willing to consider income - verification procedures for @entity109 claiming @entity10 's generous subsidies , but they insist that @entity9 will have to make additional concessions in return . those , @entity32 sources told @entity114 , would most likely be related to entitlement spending levels . sen. @entity116 quipped sunday on ' @entity117 ' that vice president @entity0 , who has been all but invisible despite his decades in the @entity32 , must be somewhere in the federal witness protection program while it 's unclear how @entity9 will react , @entity0 will be there to help @entity88 get what he wants . both sides of the @entity32 clash said monday afternoon before the @entity18 meeting that they were making significant progress . ' we have had an opportunity over the last couple of days to have some very constructive exchanges of views about how to move forward , ' @entity126 senate majority leader @entity126 said on the @entity32 floor . ' those discussions continue , and i share [ the ] optimism that we ’re going to get a result that will be acceptable to both sides . ' @entity13 senate majority leader @entity88 signaled his agreement , saying that ' constructive , good faith negotiations continue between the @entity9 leader and me . ' ' i 'm very optimistic that we will reach an agreement that 's reasonable in nature this week to reopen the government , pay the nation 's bills and begin long term negotiations to put our country on sound fiscal footing . ' @entity88 and the @entity13 want to reopen the government for only a few months , giving them the change to strong - arm republicans into accepting still more government spending president @entity20 ( c ) met on saturday with @entity32 @entity13 leaders ( l to @entity157 ) @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity88 and @entity160 , but @entity0 was @entity161 @entity9 sen. @entity116 complained during a sunday television appearance that president @entity20 has been a non-factor in the negotiations , and that @entity0 , who spent decades in the @entity32 and has a reputation as a dealmaker , has been nowhere in sight . ' i hope the president will become engaged . maybe we need to get @entity0 out of the witness protection program , ' @entity116 told host @entity171 . but the vice president will join @entity20 and the four most senior congressional leaders in a meeting whose agenda will be driven by @entity13 . @entity88 and @entity176 will be on hand with @entity18 speaker @entity178 and minority leader @entity179 . as the @entity182 's debt funding deadline approaches just three days from now , it 's @entity13 who suddenly have the wind at their backs and leverage in their pockets . on @entity189 , an aide to a senior @entity32 @entity9 was overheard talking to his boss during a walk through a @entity32 office building on monday . ' unless we hold the line on spending , ' the staffer said , ' we 're going to end up losing ground instead of gaining it . we 've got to make sure @entity126 [ @entity176 ] gets that . ' ' i 'm still not sure who put us in this box , ' added the aide , ' but we 're in it . '
