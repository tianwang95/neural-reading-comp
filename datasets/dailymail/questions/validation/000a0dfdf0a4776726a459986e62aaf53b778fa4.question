@entity0 has rejected speculation he will quit international cricket and confirmed he will target next year 's @entity4 tournament despite persistent back problems . the @entity7 opener posted ' i 'm not leaving ' alongside an @entity10 video on himself singing along with an amused singer in @entity13 on sunday . @entity0 , laughing while attempting to hit the high notes as an amusing singer covers @entity17 's @entity16 , is no doubt referring to the picturesque @entity19 on @entity20 at which he 's clearly enjoying himself . but it also follows good news for fans of the 35 - year - old 's explosive and unpredictable batting style . @entity0 sings along to a performance of @entity17 's @entity16 at @entity13 's @entity28 @entity0 poses with a female police officer in @entity13 as he takes a break in the city he calls ' @entity32 ' @entity0 posted ' it was fun while it lasted . # @entity35 ' as he relaxed on a boat after his side 's @entity38 exit ' definitely want to play the @entity4 next year for @entity7 , there 's no doubt about that , ' @entity0 told @entity43 . ' i 've got a few concerns and a few injuries to try and solve . i 'll give myself some time and hopefully look back at it and see how well i can actually progress for @entity7 cricket at this point in time . ' ' i 'm actually out of the @entity53 series , the back wo n't hold up for that format at this point in time , but i have n't retired from any format as yet . ' and why would @entity0 retire if he 's enjoying life both on and off the field . @entity0 , 35 , told @entity43 that he has no intention to retire from any form of cricket yet @entity0 hit a 33 - ball 61 in the @entity7 143 - run defeat by @entity62 in their @entity38 quarter - final the destructive opening batsman thanks the crowd in @entity65 after his side bowed out of the @entity38 also on @entity67 , who plays in the @entity68 for the @entity69 , posted happy snaps with a female police officer and of himself relaxing on a boat , along with an image on @entity74 of a meal he was enjoying ' back in paradise # @entity13 ' with the @entity78 in the background . @entity0 headed to @entity13 after the @entity7 were dumped out of the @entity38 by an impressive @entity62 outfit on saturday as his shortlived @entity38 record of 215 was broken by @entity82 's remarkable 237 . he smashed a 33 - ball 61 in the @entity7 ' unlikely chase but it was nowhere near enough as they lost the quarter - final by 143 runs . @entity0 poses with @entity82 after the @entity88 smashed his @entity38 record innings @entity0 hit 215 against @entity90 in @entity91 on february 24 but @entity82 's 237 on saturday trumped him @entity0 posed for photos with @entity82 after the match and was far from downbeat as he thanked @entity7 supporters . ' it was fun while it lasted # @entity35 , ' he wrote on @entity10 . however , they wo n't see him for a while as a recurring back injury keeps him out of the three - match @entity100 against @entity102 starting next month . @entity0 has played 103 tests and 269 @entity104 , and was instrumental in the @entity7 ' 2012 @entity4 triumph , a performance he 's keen to replicate before hanging up his bat .
