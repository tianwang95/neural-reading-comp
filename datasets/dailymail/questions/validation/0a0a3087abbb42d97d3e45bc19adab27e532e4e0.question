on his bike ? @entity2 went on a cycle ride today as he prepares to find out of he is sacked by the @entity4 over a ' fracas ' with a @entity7 producer over a steak @entity9 @entity2 appeared to be preparing for life after @entity7 today by shunning his car and choosing to go for a bike ride instead . the star , 54 , decided to cycle on the streets around his west @entity17 home this morning on the eve of an @entity4 internal report that will help decide whether he is sacked . he smiled and waved to photographers but his future at the @entity4 looks increasingly bleak after a series of @entity7 live tour dates worth £ 1million to the corporation were axed . the four roadshows scheduled for @entity27 next weekend were scrapped . tickets for the postponed shows cost between £ 42 and £ 100 , meaning the decision could cost the @entity4 more than £ 1million in lost revenue if @entity2 is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled . speculation that the @entity4 was desperate to find a way of keeping @entity2 – and the lucrative @entity7 brand – had been supported by the fact that the @entity27 tour was not cancelled despite the frontman ’s recent suspension . but last night a spokesman for the live shows , due to be attended by almost 20,000 people , announced the march 27 and 28 dates were being ‘ postponed ’ . ‘ @entity47 regrets to inform ticket holders for next week ’s shows in @entity50 that we will be postponing all four performances , ’ he said , adding that new dates would be announced at a later time . the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £ 50million a year from selling the rights to @entity7 overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world . the motoring programme is also set to make around £ 7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the @entity63 this year . the conservative estimate is based on 15,000 tickets sold for each show at the cheapest price of £ 35 each , however with more expensive tickets and vip packages available , this figure could be far higher . car manufacturers are also thought to pay to have their cars featured on the stadium tours . organisers confirmed that this weekend ’s shows had been scrapped , but insisted they were not privy to the outcome of the inquiry into @entity2 . big decision : sacking @entity2 could mean the end of @entity7 , which makes the @entity4 millions every year a source said : ‘ this is an independent decision we have to make . it is no indication of what is to come . one of @entity47 ’s main presenters remains on suspension by the @entity4 and the expected timeline on the conclusion of that investigation does not give us enough confidence that we can deliver the show expected by fans [ and ] ticket holders . ’ it emerged today that a report into @entity2 's behaviour was commissioned by @entity4 head of tv @entity99 after a series of other scandals last year . @entity7 caused an international incident after driving through @entity104 with a number plate allegedly linked to the @entity106 and used the word ' slope ' describe an @entity110 man . a report into the cases apparently concluded that @entity7 should have a new producer role to act as a go - between the show 's team and the @entity4 's management to help deal with any future crisis . the @entity4 today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions . @entity2 was suspended by the @entity4 two weeks ago , following allegations of a ‘ fracas ’ with producer @entity123 over hot food . his fate now hangs on an internal report by @entity127 , head of @entity128 , which is expected to be handed over today . a source said : ‘ the @entity4 wants to keep @entity2 if it can find a respectable way to do it . ’ a senior executive added : ‘ the @entity4 will do everything it can to keep him if it was just a bit of a dust - up , but if he is found to have punched him , then i think it ’s gone too far . ’ insiders suggested @entity2 and mr @entity123 had given ‘ quite different ’ versions of events . sources close to mr @entity123 say he was punched and left with a split lip , while @entity2 has admitted some ‘ handbags and pushing ’ but is understood to have denied anything worse . @entity2 , pictured with co ho - hosts @entity144 and @entity146 at a @entity7 live show in @entity148 , will not be performing at the four events in @entity27 as they have been cancelled the four roadshows scheduled for @entity27 next weekend were scrapped , on the eve of an internal report into @entity2 ’s fate @entity2 was suspended by the @entity4 two weeks ago , following allegations of a ‘ fracas ’ with producer @entity123 ( left ) over hot food the @entity4 is set to lose as much as £ 67million a year if @entity7 presenter @entity2 is sacked over claims he punched a producer . the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated £ 50million a year from selling the rights to @entity7 overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world . on top of that , @entity165 makes millions more from @entity168 and live shows in the @entity63 and abroad , as well as sales of dvds . the @entity4 could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give @entity2 his marching orders , with the sale of the show overseas making £ 50million . @entity168 has a global circulation of 1.7m , bringing in another estimated £ 7.4million - not including profit from advertising , as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine . the motoring programme is also set to make around £ 7.35million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the @entity63 this year . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take @entity7 – worth £ 50million a year to @entity4 coffers – off the air while the investigation was under way . ‘ the programme could and should have carried on during @entity2 ’s suspension , ’ said an insider . ‘ @entity2 wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings . ‘ he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out . ’ the stakes were raised further yesterday as the 54 - year - old reportedly promised to sue the @entity4 if he was sacked from @entity7 . it comes amid suggestions that the corporation is filming a pilot for a new motoring show called @entity209 , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges . a source told the @entity214 : ‘ if @entity2 is fired it wo n’t be the end of it . lawyers will be involved . ’ writing in the @entity217 , @entity2 also laughed off a foul - mouthed rant at @entity4 bosses filmed at a charity auction last week , claiming he only used the language ‘ in jest ’ to raise money for good causes . a petition to have @entity2 re-instated on @entity7 has gathered around one million signatures and was delivered to the @entity4 in @entity17 on friday . a decision about his future is expected this week , after the corporation ’s director - general has considered the findings of @entity233 ’s investigation .
