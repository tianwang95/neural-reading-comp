@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) @entity3 lure @entity5 and @entity6 migrants by offering discounts to get onto overcrowded ships if people bring more potential passengers , a @entity2 investigation has revealed . a smuggler in the @entity1 capital of @entity0 laid bare the system for loading boats with poor and desperate refugees , during a conversation that a @entity2 producer secretly filmed . the conversation , recorded using a mobile phone , exposes the prices and incentives used to gather as many migrants as possible onto ships . an estimated 1,600 migrants have died so far this year on the dangerous @entity26 crossing , but still more wait to try to reach @entity27 . @entity2 's producer was introduced to a @entity30 and @entity31 smuggler by an intermediary in @entity0 , who mistakenly thought she was a @entity34 looking to bring other @entity34 refugees with her onto boats to @entity37 . why i fled : migrants share their stories the smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of @entity0 near the city 's many ports , where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready . the building could only be reached by walking down a trash - littered alleyway , and featured a series of packed rooms , separated by curtains , where dozens sat -- well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat . the smuggler explained that the " final price " for @entity34 -- often thought to be richer than their african migrant counterparts -- was $ 1,000 . he added that for each @entity34 she brought with her , the producer would get a $ 100 discount . so if she brought 10 , she could travel free . he explained how the " discount " was " well known , " suggesting perhaps it was part of the unwritten rules that govern the trade and why so many migrants come to each boat . any fears about the crossing were supposed to be allayed by the smuggler insisting the boats they used had new motors , and that the @entity30 pilot would have a satellite telephone and gps to assist the crossing . he also assured @entity2 's producer , when asked , that if the people became too many , they would use two boats . pregnant women among migrants trying to cross
