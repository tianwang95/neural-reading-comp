( @entity2 ) @entity1 ice cream has temporarily shut down one of its manufacturing plants over the discovery of listeria contamination in a serving of ice cream originating from that plant . public health officials warned consumers friday not to eat any @entity1 - branded products made at the company 's @entity13 , @entity15 , plant . that includes 3 - ounce servings of @entity1 ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity28 behind the coding date . the warning by the @entity31 does not affect other @entity1 ice cream , including other 3 - ounce servings , not made at the plant . but @entity1 has recalled other products . the company is shutting down the @entity13 facility " out of an abundance of caution " to search for a possible cause of contamination . it is the third time @entity1 has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a @entity47 hospital that served the company 's ice cream . listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital . the cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the @entity13 plant in april 2014 , @entity1 said . and , according to the @entity31 , listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant . the bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically , the @entity31 said . but they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the @entity47 outbreak . in a separate outbreak in @entity69 , the @entity31 did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3 - ounce @entity1 cups matched the listeria in recovered samples . none of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections . " investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to @entity1 products is ongoing , " the @entity31 said . in early march , in light of the @entity47 listeria outbreak , @entity1 recalled a group of products made at a plant in @entity69 . it later added 3 - ounce cup servings to the recall . five people were infected and three died in the past year in @entity47 from listeria that might be linked to @entity1 products , according to the @entity31 . all five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis , the @entity31 said . at least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with @entity1 ice cream before developing the infection . " we are devastated and know that @entity1 has to be and can be better than this , " @entity105 , @entity1 ceo and president , said in a statement . " quality and safety have always been our top priorities . we are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected . " the @entity31 advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away . in a statement on its website , @entity1 said " this recall in no way includes @entity1 ice cream half gallons , pints , quarts , 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups . " this has been the first product recall in the 108 - year history of @entity1 , the company said . @entity129 is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the @entity31 . symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . in the @entity144 , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters . @entity2 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .

three people in @placeholder have died from a listeria outbreak
