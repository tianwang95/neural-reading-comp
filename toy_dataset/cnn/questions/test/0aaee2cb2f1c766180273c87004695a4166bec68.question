( @entity3 ) @entity2 did not get timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into a seat belt while being transported in a police van , @entity1 police said friday . police commissioner @entity7 told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that @entity2 was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station . five days after @entity2 's death and amid ongoing protests , police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest . @entity2 , who was stopped april 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes , should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest , said deputy police commissioner @entity22 . a witness said the man was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing . @entity7 told reporters in an afternoon news conference : " we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times . " investigators are trying to learn more about @entity2 's condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station . at the first stop , @entity2 was placed in leg irons . the driver stopped a second time " to deal with mr. @entity2 and the facts of that interaction are under investigation , " @entity22 said . the van stopped one more time to add a second prisoner . @entity7 told reporters that at the third stop an officer saw @entity2 on the floor of the van , asking for a medic . the officer and the van driver picked him up and put him on the seat , the commissioner said . when the van arrived at the @entity59 station , police called for an ambulance , said @entity22 , who is in charge of the investigation . an attorney for the @entity2 family said it was positive news , but there is a more important issue . " it 's certainly a step towards acknowledging the truth that the police did not follow their own internal regulations , " @entity69 told @entity3 's " @entity75 . " " what it does not get at is , it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did mr. @entity2 need medical attention in the first place ? ... that 's the question that still has not been answered . " the developments came two days after a police union attorney spoke of the possibility that the injuries occurred during a " rough ride , " a frequently claimed practice in which police vehicles are deliberately driven in a way that injures suspects . at least two suspects have won court cases against the city after being left paralyzed in such rides over the last decade or so , the @entity94 reported thursday . @entity2 died sunday , one week after @entity1 police arrested him . at some point , he suffered a severe spinal cord injury . his family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died . @entity7 said he had been given preliminary results of an autopsy on @entity2 . the medical examiner 's full autopsy may take another 30 to 45 days , @entity7 said , because toxicology tests still need to be examined and spinal experts may be brought in to assess @entity2 's injury . meanwhile , anger over the incident and the police response to it continued to grow ahead of a major rally that organizers vowed would " shut this city down on saturday . " " the people are demanding immediate arrests , immediate end to the protracted investigation , and immediate end to the stonewalling , " said @entity119 , president of @entity120 . but he and other officials vowed the protests would be peaceful -- much as they were thursday night , despite a few scuffles and two detentions . " no one has come to try and burn @entity1 down , " another protest organizer , the rev. @entity131 , told reporters . mayor @entity134 thanked those protesters who have demonstrated peacefully . " our community is very clear . they demand answers and so do i , " she said . the mayor said that will take some time , but she had concerns about what happened to @entity2 . " i still want to know why the policies and procedures for transport were not followed , " @entity134 said . " i realize there is frustration over this investigation , but i want to be clear : there is a process , but we have to respect that process . " @entity7 addressed calls for his resignation after @entity2 's death by saying he would not step down . police first encountered @entity2 as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity . when @entity2 saw them , authorities said , he started running . @entity2 was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him . an attorney for @entity2 's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size . one video of @entity2 's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van , his legs dangling limply behind him . " his leg look broke ! " a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video . that witness , who only wants to be identified as @entity181 , said she knew @entity2 as a joker and a ladies ' man . but that day , he said only one thing to her . " when i ran up the street and seen him , the first thing i asked him was he ok because i heard him screaming , " @entity181 said . " he did n't never say yes or no , he just said , ' i ca n't breathe , ' and just was yelling . " @entity2 's family attorneys and protesters said police did n't have any probable cause to chase him but did so only because he was " running while black . " police union attorney @entity194 said officers had every right to give chase . " there is a @entity200 case that states that if you are in a high - crime area , and you flee from the police unprovoked , the police have the legal ability to pursue you , and that 's what they did , " he said . " in this type of an incident , you do not need probable cause to arrest . you just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop . " @entity212 , an attorney for the @entity2 family , said " police have a lot of questions that need to be answered . " " what was the reasonable suspicion ? why were they arresting our client ? " he said . " he had no weapon in his hand . he was committing no crime , and he was n't hurting anybody . the police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him , " the attorney said . the @entity2 family has not yet seen the preliminary autopsy report , attorney @entity227 said . @entity69 said the family has commissioned an independent autopsy . while police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators , the department has not released details of what the officers said or how @entity2 might have suffered the fatal injury . the sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions , @entity7 said . @entity1 protests : 5 questions demonstrators are asking the @entity246 is investigating whether @entity2 's civil rights were violated during the arrest . @entity134 said earlier she " absolutely " believes an outside investigation is needed , especially given the history of police misconduct . a wake will be held sunday for @entity2 , with a memorial service and funeral following on monday . @entity3 's @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 contributed to this report .
