@entity0 ( @entity1 ) this was the handshake that shook the @entity3 . president @entity4 briefly met his @entity6 counterpart , @entity5 , on friday night at a dinner for the dozens of @entity9 leaders convening in @entity0 for the @entity10 . this was historic . the two nations have barely been on speaking terms -- officially -- for more than 50 years . the meeting was so important that @entity17 , @entity18 spokesperson , issued a statement : " at the @entity10 this evening , president @entity4 and president @entity5 greeted each other and shook hands . " @entity6 and the @entity21 had endured a half - century of enmity , the tension worsened by the two nations being only 90 miles apart . key events of those years include some of the most traumatic in modern @entity21 history , such as the @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity27 of 1980 . but the two leaders have been building up to the historic face - to - face . @entity4 spoke by phone wednesday with the @entity6 leader before heading to @entity0 . they met friday at the dinner and are expected to spend a lot more time together on saturday when the summit begins in earnest . @entity4 arrived in @entity0 late thursday for the conference , which in years past was tinged with animosity at @entity6 's exclusion . moments after @entity41 , @entity4 's helicopter , touched down in @entity0 , @entity5 's plane landed on the same tarmac . @entity45 television carried both arrivals live . during their phone call wednesday , @entity4 and @entity5 discussed the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the @entity21 and @entity6 , according to deputy national security adviser @entity51 . he said it " made sense " for the two leaders to communicate before their anticipated interactions friday and saturday . those run - ins will represent the highest - level talks between the @entity21 and @entity6 since a meeting between then - vice president @entity58 and then - prime minister @entity59 in 1959 . " we 're in new territory here , " @entity51 said on friday . " the reason we 're here is that the president strongly believes that an approach that was focused totally on isolation , focused totally on seeking to cut off the @entity6 people from the @entity21 had failed . " @entity4 was expecting a warm welcome from the dozens of countries represented at the conference , after announcing in december he was seeking to engage @entity71 in talks over reopening embassies and removing barriers to commerce and travel . in @entity0 , @entity4 is expected to announce he 's removing @entity6 from the @entity21 ' list of countries that sponsor terrorism , a major advance in building diplomatic ties between the two countries . the @entity83 delivered its report on the designation to the @entity86 on wednesday ; @entity4 said on thursday a panel of experts was reviewing it before he makes a final determination . the @entity86 is n't ruling out a final decision before @entity4 leaves @entity0 late saturday night . in remarks during a brief stopover in @entity94 on thursday , @entity4 strongly hinted he was ready to remove @entity6 from the list , which also includes @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 . " throughout this process , our emphasis has been on the facts , " @entity4 said . " so we want to make sure that given that this is a powerful tool to isolate those countries that genuinely do support terrorism , that when we make those designations we 've got strong evidence that , in fact , that 's the case . " " as circumstances change , then that list will change as well , " he said . while some inside @entity6 have expressed dissatisfaction at the pace of the diplomatic thaw , @entity21 officials say they 're pleased at the progress toward re-establishing diplomatic ties , which the @entity86 argues has helped improve relations with other countries in the region . @entity4 said in @entity94 he " never foresaw that immediately overnight everything would transform itself . " the overtures to @entity6 have not been universally popular in the @entity21 ; some lawmakers were irate that @entity4 was seeking to engage what they regard as a corrupt government . even as @entity4 landed in @entity0 the long - standing tensions between pro- and @entity128 activists was on full display . dissidents opposed to @entity5 's regime were violently accosted earlier this week by supporters of the @entity6 government . @entity51 said the @entity86 had " expressed serious concerns " about the violence and would continue to speak in support of human rights reforms on the island .
