@entity4 , @entity2 ( @entity3 ) for a decade , the @entity0 -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and @entity2 . opened to the public in 2005 in @entity4 in the south of the country , the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment , shops and eateries . outside the mall , a giant @entity17 sphinx and a replica of the @entity19 were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with @entity24 gondolas . it even boasted an indoor roller coaster . but despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came . soon , it was classified by industry analysts as a " dead mall " and it became an unflattering symbol of @entity2 's runaway speculation on real estate projects . the mall spans five million square feet of shopping area , making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of @entity43 , the biggest shopping center in the @entity44 . when i visited two years ago , the mall was deserted . most units were empty . paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded . the air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere . the occupancy rate was less than 10 % . it was a walk through a ghost mall . however , a visit in late march revealed a different picture . the mall was buzzing with activity . large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops , restaurants and entertainment venues . visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans , dining at the @entity72 , @entity73 or @entity2 restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities . screams and laughter can be heard from merry - go - rounds . " it 's been a big change . it 's a clear modernization , " said @entity79 , an @entity80 teacher from the @entity44 who is living in @entity4 with his wife @entity81 , also a teacher . " we come here at least once a month now . " despite the signs of life , much of the mall is still vacant . but most of the unoccupied units , along with halls and walkways are under renovation . even on a saturday , it 's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack - hammering and sawing . ms @entity96 , head of @entity0 's marketing unit , told @entity3 that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring , when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants . " all construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in may , " she said , declining to give her full name . " we expect that from may , we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops . " she said she could n't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media . ms @entity115 , head of investments , confirmed that " business is really great , " but would not comment further . @entity120 retail chain @entity118 , which has expanded its supermarket to two floors , explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall 's " upgrading and retrofitting program . " there are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall . when i spoke to her , @entity133 , a young @entity2 woman , was just two days away from opening a little café called " @entity137 " in one of the passage ways being renovated . sitting on the sidewalk outside the café , she and her partners were busy washing up cups , classes and plates ahead of the big day . " i 'm so excited ! " she said , showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when i last visited the mall two years ago . " you must come , my coffee is the best in @entity2 ! " the area around the previously run - down @entity19 is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes . in january , a globe shaped @entity160 - style cinema was launched at the outdoor square . one of the more eye - catching new sources of entertainment is a role - playing amusement center for children called @entity167 . today , it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall . it 's hard to believe how rapid the change has been . economist @entity173 says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target @entity2 's middle , rather than , upper class , is a smart move on behalf of the developers . " many large malls ( and residential construction ) in @entity2 ... . are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class , " he said . " what is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to ( the much larger ) bulk of middle - class @entity2 . " and , he says , other developments that were once labeled " ghost cities " have gone on to thrive . " one to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments , so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional , " @entity173 said . despite its retrofitting program , the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly . most of @entity4 's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet . the town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in @entity2 or to @entity211 where wages are lower . @entity2 is also haunted by serious problems in its real - estate market , with over investment and large vacancy rates . in march , prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month . what 's more , the mall 's latest re-launch is not its first . in 2007 , the mall changed name from " @entity0 " to " @entity0 , @entity231 " and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the @entity226 , a conglomerate set up by @entity228 , and its subsidiary @entity230 . but the revamp failed and the mall remained empty . now , the owners are hoping for third time lucky . @entity237 : inside a @entity2 ghost city
