@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- the bloody beating of @entity4 's son on a @entity6 sidewalk last week followed a search for the 20 - year - old because the actor wanted to see his son before leaving town , a source with knowledge of the incident said . a lawyer for @entity4 said he was " looking for @entity16 because he did n't have his cell phone and he wanted to get in touch with him to do some recording . " @entity4 's request that the man he paid to be his son 's assistant locate his son " does n't justify what occurred , which was a deliberate , provoked attack where @entity16 was in no condition to defend himself , " @entity4 attorney @entity21 said monday . the younger @entity4 asked @entity0 police to investigate the assistant , @entity30 , for the alleged assault , according @entity33 sgt. @entity32 . @entity34 was fired after the incident last week . @entity16 was placed under a psychiatric hold after @entity0 police responded to the incident tuesday , but he was released over the weekend . cell phone video posted online showed @entity16 being repeatedly hit as he was pinned down on a sidewalk . " he wanted @entity30 to leave , and what happened , at least three witnesses told me , there was a provocation , " @entity21 said . " @entity16 threw a weak kick . he put @entity16 down on the floor , and he began a barrage of punches , 13 to 15 to the face . " " i deeply lament the incident that occurred between me and @entity16 last tuesday , " @entity34 said , " and plead with the media and the public to suspend their judgment of the episode until all of the facts come to light . " the violent incident came amid a dispute between @entity16 's mother , @entity61 , and @entity4 over how to deal with their son 's psychological issues , which are outlined in legal document filed in @entity66 's lawsuit against @entity4 . she said she put her acting career on hold for two decades to raise the child while @entity4 , one of @entity6 's highest - paid actors , pursued his career . @entity66 is suing @entity4 over unpaid taxes and the @entity6 home where she raised @entity16 , and is seeking to regain legal control over her son , who court documents say suffers from " a number of mental , psychological and physical ailments . " he lived with @entity66 after she and @entity4 , who were never married , split up when @entity16 was a child . @entity34 was hired several years ago as @entity16 's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school . he later became a personal assistant to @entity4 to help with his son . " because of a confidentiality agreement , i am limited in what i can share publicly on this matter , " @entity34 said . " i 'm grateful that @entity16 is getting the care that he needs and wish him all the best . " @entity34 was following orders from @entity4 to find and hold on to his adult son the afternoon of the incident , said the source , who asked not to be identified because of legal and confidentiality issues . the older @entity4 's lawyer denied the actor asked the assistant to hold on to his son . he only wanted to have the younger @entity4 call his father , @entity21 said . the source disputed an initial report that the fight began when @entity34 told @entity16 he could not order a certain item from a restaurant menu . @entity66 blames @entity4 for what she said is her son 's downward spiral since he turned 18 and left her legal guardianship . " i do not want him with @entity4 , " @entity66 said . " i do not want him in that care . that is not the care my son needs . " @entity16 , in a statement delivered through his father 's lawyer friday afternoon , said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care . " i am an adult , " @entity16 said . " i do n't want to have anything to do with my mother . any problems that i have ever had is because of the relationship that i had with my mother . " when @entity66 heard the quote , she called it " an absolute disgrace , " suggesting that @entity4 's lawyer solicited a statement from her son while he was under a psychiatric hold at @entity133 . " my son is under a spell . he 's under a trance , " @entity66 said . " @entity16 would say whatever his dad wants him to say . " @entity66 said it is @entity4 's fault that their son is in a hospital . " he had his chance , " she said of the elder @entity4 . " he had his chance to make it right . my son had a healthy environment here . he had a system that was fantastic . i built that with myself and my team . " she said she fired @entity34 three years ago , but @entity4 rehired him , she said . @entity4 , in a statement from his spokeswoman friday , called @entity66 's comments blaming him for his son 's psychiatric troubles " unfortunate and inappropriate . " " this is a time to focus only on giving love and full support to @entity16 , not an opportunity to lay blame on his father , a man who loves his son very deeply , " @entity4 said . @entity66 said @entity4 was rarely around for her son growing up , while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues . " for 18 years , i raised @entity16 so @entity4 could go be @entity4 , and go be a superstar , and he did , " she said . " so i raised this boy , 24/7 , we were glued to the hip . " after @entity16 's 18th birthday , his father " orchestrated " his removal from her care by persuading the employees she hired to work for him and giving @entity16 his own home and money , @entity66 said . " they all go work with @entity4 because he has the money and he has the bank account and he has the fame , and i do n't , " she said . @entity16 's special needs were not being met without her , she said . " my son right now has been under the care of @entity4 , " she said . " that did n't work . it 's very obvious it did n't work . it failed miserably , failed miserably . " @entity21 , @entity4 's lawyer , said @entity66 's lawsuit against @entity4 is her motivation for attacking her son 's father . " ms. @entity61 comments about mr. @entity4 are absurd , and it 's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her , " @entity21 said . " this is clearly all about money for ms. @entity61 . " @entity66 's lawyer said she would file for conservatorship of her son next week so she could ensure that he will get the care he needs when he is eventually released from the psychiatric hold . " i 'd like my son to be with his mom , where it worked , " @entity66 said . " i 'd like my son to be in an environment where it worked . you know , 18 years of being successful , 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that i have given him and all the support . why would you mess with that ? why would you interfere with that ? my son needs to be home . "

new : it does n't justify a " deliberate , provoked attack , " @placeholder 's lawyer says
