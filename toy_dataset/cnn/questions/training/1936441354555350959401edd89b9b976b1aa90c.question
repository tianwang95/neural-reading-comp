@entity0 ( @entity1 ) -- president @entity2 took the push for his stalled $ 447 billion jobs plan to @entity5 on monday , telling two audiences that alternative proposals put forward by his @entity10 critics amount to little more than sops to the rich that will gut critical regulations and fail to restore economic growth . my " bill will help put people back to work and give our economy a boost right away , " @entity2 told a morning crowd at @entity17 . " but apparently , none of this matters " to @entity10 leaders . " i 've gone out of my way to find areas of cooperation " with congressional @entity10 , the president declared . " we 're going to give members of @entity34 another chance to step up to the plate and do the right thing . " but " if they vote against these proposals again ... then they 're not going to have to answer to me . they 're going to have to answer to you , " he said . later monday , @entity2 told students at @entity44 in @entity45 that @entity10 opposition to his plan " makes no sense , " and he criticized the @entity10 alternative proposal as an attempt to satisfy the party 's conservative wing . " it 's way overdue for us to stop trying to satisfy some branch of the party and take some common - sense steps to help " the economy and the nation , he said to a cheering crowd . since @entity2 's plan was rejected in the @entity62 -- due to unanimous @entity10 opposition -- @entity65 leaders have decided to try to move it through @entity34 by breaking it up into a series of smaller legislative proposals . but his appearance , analysts note , was as much about campaign politics as the bill . the president will spend the next three days on a bus tour through politically pivotal @entity5 and @entity76 -- two states carried by @entity2 in 2008 but considered up for grabs next year . veteran sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , whom @entity2 defeated in the 2008 election , criticized the president monday for using the taxpayer - funded trip for what @entity79 called political campaigning . " on the taxpayer - paid dime , the president is now traveling , attacking the @entity10 plan , " @entity79 said on the @entity62 floor . while noting @entity2 's right to level such criticism in a political venue , @entity79 added : " is that appropriate on the taxpayer 's dime , since it is clearly campaigning ? " in @entity99 , the crowd repeatedly chanted " four more years " before and during @entity2 's remarks . " i appreciate the ' four more years , ' but right now , i 'm thinking about the next 13 months , " the president said . " we do n't have time to wait . we 've got a choice right now . " @entity2 's senior strategist , @entity105 , vowed sunday that every part of the bill will eventually have a vote . " the @entity112 people support every single plank of that bill , and we 're going to vote on every single one of them , " @entity105 said on @entity110 's " @entity109 . " he would not say which part of the plan would come first . republicans will " get a vote on whether they believe we should protect tax breaks for small business owners and middle - class @entity112 , or whether we should protect tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires , " @entity2 said in a written statement last tuesday . meanwhile , demonstrators in @entity129 said they 'd gather monday to protest the @entity10 's stance on the president 's jobs bill . house speaker @entity133 , @entity134 , and @entity129 reps . @entity136 and @entity137 will be together in the area for a fundraising event . " members of the @entity144 , teachers and health care workers will deliver a petition to @entity133 signed by 25,000 @entity144 members ... demanding that he hold a vote on president @entity2 's @entity150 , " a statement from the demonstrators said . @entity153 majority leader @entity152 , @entity76 , said over the weekend that there could be agreement on some elements . " let 's work together . let 's find some of the things in his plan that we agree with , and let 's go ahead and do that for the @entity112 people , " he told " @entity166 . " the past week was an indication that " we can come together , " @entity152 said , citing the passage of three trade bills . @entity152 did not make clear exactly where areas of agreement may be . but he cited the need to help small businesses find capital , unemployment insurance reform and infrastructure spending as broad ideas for which both sides have expressed support . but " we 're not going to be for tax increases on small businesses , " @entity152 said of the president 's plan . republicans filibustered the @entity62 version of the president 's jobs bill last week , though a handful of @entity65 had said they would have opposed the measure if it had made it to the chamber 's floor . among other things , @entity2 's overall blueprint includes an extension and expansion of the current payroll tax cut , an extension of jobless benefits , new tax credits for businesses that hire the long - term unemployed and additional money to help save and create jobs for teachers and first responders such as firefighters . the largest measure in the package is the payroll tax cut , which comes at a projected cost of $ 265 billion . employees normally pay 6.2 % on their first $ 106,800 of wages into @entity216 , but they are now paying only 4.2 % . that break is set to expire at the end of december . @entity2 wants to cut the tax in half , to 3.1 % . republicans previously embraced the cut , but have increasingly questioned its economic merit . a second key measure -- estimated to cost roughly $ 44 billion -- is the extension of emergency jobless benefits to help the long - term unemployed . lawmakers first expanded benefits to cover 99 weeks in 2009 , and have since reauthorized the expansion five times . @entity10 are at particularly sharp odds with @entity65 over how to pay for the plan . @entity10 leaders oppose a provision that would fund the measure through a 5.6 % surtax on annual incomes over $ 1 million . @entity10 have accused the president of engaging in so - called " class warfare , " while @entity65 say wealthier @entity112 need to share in the cost of fiscal responsibility . on monday , a @entity62 @entity65 leadership aide told @entity1 that @entity65 will seek a 0.5 % surtax on annual incomes over $ 1 million to pay for the first individual component of @entity2 's broader jobs package . that component of the larger jobs bill would provide $ 35 billion in aid to states to help preserve jobs for teachers and first responders , the @entity153 and @entity62 majority leader @entity247 's office said . however , a top @entity62 @entity10 leadership aide immediately said that @entity10 -- and some @entity65 -- probably would not be willing to go along with a tax increase to pay for the measure . @entity1 's @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .
