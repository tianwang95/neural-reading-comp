@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) -- the @entity5 price tag for relief in @entity1 has hit $ 170 million , the federal government announced thursday as ton after ton of relief supplies headed into the island nation through a crucial reopened pier . the vast majority of the committed federal aid -- $ 140 million -- is from the @entity14 under the @entity15 , according to the @entity16 . and the need within @entity1 -- still reeling from last week 's devastating 7.0 - magnitude earthquake -- only grows by the minute . after days of being closed to much needed food and supplies , the south pier at @entity0 was channeling aid into the leveled capital city . the supplies were brought into @entity0 on trucks traveling on a repaired gravel road leading from the port . sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks and many small food stores were open . dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut - filled dirt side street . a smaller market on a street corner saw some business . however , the longest and most visible lines in @entity1 's capital were not for food , water or gas -- they were for money . earthquake survivors need cash and are waiting hours outside wire transfer businesses , including @entity50 , that are starting to reopen . " i have not eaten for two days , " said 32 - year - old @entity51 , who waited more than six hours outside a money - wiring branch . " i 'm only drinking water . " meanwhile , a @entity56 @entity55 ship , the @entity57 , was docked at the city 's south pier thursday , unloading 90 tons of humanitarian aid . two other ships had previously offloaded containers . the reopened pier is older and smaller than the north pier , which was rendered unusable by the january 12 earthquake . the south pier was damaged , but @entity1 port authorities and the @entity5 military were able to put it back in adequate shape . workers also repaired the road leading into the city and laid gravel on it . unloading of aid , however , was a slow process . the road allows only for one - way traffic , meaning a truck drives to the end of the pier , is loaded with supplies , and then drives out . also , because of concerns about overloading the pier , only one truck is allowed on it at a time . repairs on the pier continue , said @entity91 lt. cmdr . @entity92 . " we 're working on it . we 've got a long ways to go . ... if we lose this pier , that 's it . we ca n't bring in anything . " however , the reopening of the pier and the repairing of the road represented a major development in efforts to get aid to earthquake victims , in that ships can carry much more cargo than air airplanes . authorities hope to get two - way traffic going on the pier by friday , which would speed up the process . a 5.9 - magnitude aftershock wednesday stopped efforts at the pier for about three hours . @entity55 divers had to go back in the water and reassess the pier 's structural integrity , officials said . there was no immediate word if two less intense aftershocks thursday , measured at magnitude 4.9 and 4.8 , also caused a delay . full coverage @entity129 updates lt. gen. @entity130 of @entity131 announced the pier 's reopening on thursday in @entity134 . officials hope to move about 150 containers of aid thursday and 250 on friday . they want to increase that to 800 containers a day . the reopening comes as @entity5 officials have been stung by criticism of aid efforts in recent days . some of that criticism has been leveled by aid groups such as @entity146 , who blamed five victims ' deaths on delays , saying several flights carrying medical supplies had been diverted from the @entity0 airport into the neighboring @entity154 . working under adverse conditions with limited supplies , medical teams have been forced to improvise . list of missing , found in @entity1 are you there ? impact your world @entity162 , field coordinator for @entity146 told @entity2 this week that staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations . a @entity2 crew loaned a medic a pocket knife for another operation . lacking rubbing alcohol , doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments . surgical patients are being given over-the - counter pain medicine because doctors lack any stronger medication . one nurse used a string of @entity184 lights as a makeshift extension cord . a belt was used as a tourniquet , and when that broke , a garden hose . @entity191 troops , meanwhile , were working to open an airport in @entity193 on thursday , another step that could speed delivery of relief supplies . and @entity5 @entity131 , through its component @entity199 , conducted an air drop of food and water over @entity203 , @entity1 , on thursday . @entity203 is 25 miles northeast of @entity0 . a @entity205 delivered water bottles and 17,200 meals ready to eat , the military said in a statement . troops secured an area in which to drop the supplies and , once the supplies were on the ground , the military , the @entity14 and other personnel distributed them , the statement said . @entity218 troops also assisted , the @entity199 said . thursday 's air drop was the second since the quake ; the first was monday . @entity130 said thursday that 120 to 140 flights a day are coming into the single - runway @entity0 airport , compared with 25 per day just after the quake struck last week . more than 840 have landed since the airport was reopened , but there is a waiting list of 1,400 to come in , he said . a senior administration official acknowledged that not all aid , particularly medical supplies , is getting through fast enough but said that in recent days , at least half of the flights entering @entity1 are carrying humanitarian supplies . most of the other 50 percent of flights , including those of the @entity5 military and foreign governments , are still carrying some kind of aid . " of course i 'm not satisfied with getting material and personnel in for everyone who needs it , " @entity5 secretary of state @entity242 said earlier wednesday . " realistically , i am aware of the difficulties that this terrible natural disaster has posed . " the senior administration official said that more than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running . @entity130 said more than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered , along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies . about 13,100 @entity5 troops are in and around @entity1 , nearly 2,700 on the ground and another 10,400 off shore . many @entity258 spend time in @entity1 during the day but sleep on ships at night . more @entity5 troops are scheduled to arrive by this weekend , bringing the total to about 4,600 troops on the ground . at least 72,000 people -- including dozens of @entity265 staff members -- have been confirmed dead in the earthquake , according to the country 's prime minister . international aid contributions have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars , but relief agencies working in @entity1 say transportation bottlenecks and poor communications have slowed the delivery of food , water and medicine to survivors . on wednesday , @entity14 administrator @entity279 ordered more medicine and other supplies to be sent within the next 24 hours , the administration official said . lt. gen. @entity282 , the head of the @entity5 military task force in @entity1 , said any aircraft identified as carrying medical supplies would have priority for landing . they are turned away only " if there 's no parking space on the ramp , and they do n't have sufficient fuel to hold in their holding pattern , " he said . another senior @entity5 military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said wednesday that the priorities for aid flights are set " by the government of @entity1 first and then by the @entity265 second . " but the number of flights that can land at @entity0 is " a sheer issue of physics and geometry ; you just ca n't get them all in there . " to improve the flow of air traffic , the @entity5 military said wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the @entity154 's air base at @entity316 , about 135 miles ( 220 kilometers ) east of @entity0 . the @entity5 military has the ability to build dirt runways that rugged cargo planes such as the @entity321 can use , but the equipment needed to build those is " always at a premium , " the senior official said . the military has 63 helicopters in the region , @entity130 said . @entity2 's @entity328 , @entity329 , @entity330 , @entity331 and @entity332 contributed to this report .
