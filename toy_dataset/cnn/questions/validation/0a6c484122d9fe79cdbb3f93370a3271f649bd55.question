( @entity9 ) on saturday , just hours after four suicide bombers set off a series of blasts in the northeastern @entity5 city of @entity6 that left at least fifty people dead and scores more wounded , the militant organization thought responsible for the attacks , @entity11 , reportedly announced that it was swearing allegiance to the so - called @entity13 in @entity14 and @entity15 ( @entity16 ) . according to a report quoting the site extremist monitoring organization , an audio recording purportedly from @entity11 's leader , @entity20 , hailed @entity16 leader @entity21 as " caliph " and declared : " we announce our allegiance to the @entity25 ... and will hear and obey in times of difficulty and prosperity . " this latest development is not entirely unexpected given the increasing convergence between the two groups over the course of the last year as well as the severe pressure that the militaries of @entity5 and its neighbors have recently ( if somewhat belatedly ) brought to bear on it . in fact , the " shout - outs " exchanged regularly between @entity11 and @entity16 were not just rhetorical flourishes , but indicative of a veritable courtship as the former appropriated more and more of the latter 's symbolism , tactics , and ideology . this is n't the first time that @entity11 has adapted itself to conform with a larger extremist network that could aid it : previously the group underwent a similar evolution after @entity20 took over from its slain founder , @entity51 , in 2009 and aligned it with @entity53 's affiliate in @entity54 , @entity52 ( @entity52 ) , which gave @entity11 training as well as facilitated its carrying out of @entity5 's first suicide bombings in 2011 . despite the assistance that @entity11 received from @entity52 and other aligned groups in the years since , the @entity5 militants ' ideology and brutal tactics have progressively drawn closer to those of @entity16 . like @entity16 , @entity11 has progressed far beyond asymmetric terrorist attacks to sophisticated military operations resulting in its successfully overrunning and effectively controlling large parts in northeastern @entity5 and displacing millions of people . just two weeks ago , in his most recent annual @entity67 , director of national intelligence @entity69 warned the @entity71 that " @entity11 will probably continue to solidify its control over its self - declared @entity74 state in northeastern @entity5 and expand its terror campaign into neighboring @entity5 states , @entity77 , @entity78 , and @entity79 . " the timing of @entity20 's pledge of allegiance is not without its strategic logic . notwithstanding its string of victories through the beginning of this year , @entity11 has been reeling in recent weeks from a series of military defeats at the hands of the @entity5 armed forces as well as a multinational force from neighboring countries , including @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity77 . the @entity5 government and its regional allies have been pushing back and , in quite a number of instances , retaking towns . likewise , @entity16 has seen its rampage through @entity15 and @entity14 stall and it has increasingly been put on the defensive by operations like the massive @entity103 - backed @entity14 offensive to retake @entity104 this past week . thus for both groups the new linkage provides a much - needed propaganda fillip at a just the right moment . so what does the pledge mean moving forward ? at least in the short term , the merger will not have much immediate impact on the battlefield : the different social and political contexts in which each operates and the vast geographical distance separating the two groups means that each will have to face its foes with little more than moral support from each other , notwithstanding some evidence of possible collaboration in cyberspace and in terms of media production . however , finding the military noose tightening around him , and with the approbation of his new @entity16 overlord who has embraced all manner of brutal tactics ranging from mass kidnappings and executions to the burning alive of a captured @entity137 pilot , @entity20 can be expected to give even freer rein to the gruesome tactics for which he stands out , even among company such as this . and with @entity5 scheduled to cast ballots in a hotly contested presidential election on march 28 , it is virtually guaranteed that militants , who reject democratic politics along with other " infidel " ideas , will target the electioneering and voting processes as well as try to exploit whatever disputes and tensions arise from them . saturday 's quadruple bombing in @entity6 may just be the start of an intensified campaign of terrorist attacks . over time , however , it could lead to the internationalization of a threat that has up to now largely been confined geographically . there is the risk that fighters from @entity54 and other areas finding it harder to migrate to the @entity16 caliphate 's territory in the @entity167 , may well choose to move to the @entity11 emirate instead . in fact , the international support recently pouring in for the multinational @entity172 force from the @entity173 , @entity174 , the @entity175 , and others may render the @entity5 militants ' fight all the more attractive to these foreign jihadists . on the other hand , @entity11 's success as a movement has largely been the result of its denunciations of the @entity5 political elites resonating with the many ordinary citizens as well as its ethnic appeal to the @entity189 population in particular , both of which advantages could be lost if it becomes merely another " province " of a far - flung " @entity13 " focused on a broader jihadist cause . all this suggests that it remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of affiliation with @entity16 -- including possible new streams of recruits , funding , and media and other support -- will offset @entity11 's recent battlefield losses or outweigh the damage that it will incur as result , including greater attention from @entity207 militaries and security agencies . what is clear , however , is that @entity11 has shown once again that it remains one of the fastest - evolving jihadist groups , one that bears close watching not only for its challenge to the security of @entity54 's most populous country and its biggest economy , but for its not insignificant threat to the wider region .
