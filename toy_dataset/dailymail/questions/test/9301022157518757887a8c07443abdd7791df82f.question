@entity1 manager @entity0 insists @entity3 's players will not be affected by any supporters ' protests at @entity6 on saturday . the @entity7 have lost their last six @entity9 games under caretaker manager @entity10 and more demonstrations are planned for the visit of @entity1 after a significantly smaller crowd than usual saw last weekend 's 3 - 1 home defeat to @entity16 . campaign organisers protesting over @entity19 's ownership have said they will support anyone who wishes to boycott once again and have asked fans to stand up on 34 minutes inside @entity6 on saturday - to reflect the £ 34million the club left in the bank during the last financial year rather than investing in the squad . @entity3 fans have planned a mass protest against owner @entity19 on saturday afternoon at least 10,000 supporters stayed away from @entity6 for the club 's last home game against @entity16 fans are unhappy at the club 's lack of ambition , despite owner @entity19 having £ 34million in the bank but @entity36 claims the backdrop to the game will have no bearing on the actual 90 minutes , saying : ' as a player there 's nothing you can do about that - you have to concentrate on your football . ' no player goes out on the pitch without the intention of giving his best and i 'm sure all the @entity3 fans will be thinking that . ' they 'll want to put on a display and do well in front of their crowd and bounce back from recent results , and as a player you are there to perform . ' the supporters ' group have asked fans to stand in the 34th minute of saturday 's match against @entity1 @entity10 was handed the @entity3 reins until the end of the season after @entity67 quit the club in late december to become @entity70 boss . and @entity0 sees similarities between himself and @entity10 as he became @entity1 manager in february 2014 with the @entity74 outfit involved in a relegation battle at the time . ' i was in that position at the end of last season , although maybe it 's a little bit different because @entity10 's been a coach for a number of years and has got that experience , ' said @entity0 , whose side have equalled @entity1 's best ever @entity9 points total with five games still remaining . fans boycotting the @entity16 match hold banners demanding the resignation of @entity19 as @entity3 director ' but in terms of taking over at a difficult moment for the club and trying to get results straight away , it 's similar . ' the times i 've met him , he 's a fantastic guy with a lot of experience , he speaks well and is pushing his players to get the best . that 's in his character , and you see that in his interviews . ' i have sympathy for him in a way because as a manager you have to get results , but i 'm sure he is giving 100 per cent and putting all his knowledge and experience into it . ' @entity3 supporters have also been asked to take part in peaceful protests outside sports direct stores @entity1 are unbeaten on their three @entity9 visits to @entity3 , winning twice and drawing once , and secured their top - flight status last season by winning 2 - 1 at @entity6 towards the end of april . ' we 've done well there over the years and it 's a great place to go and play your football , ' @entity0 said . ' you 're in the game to play in those big stadiums and our players are used to those arenas now as they are established @entity9 players . ' hopefully we can use the crowd against the team if we perform well , but the idea is to focus on ourselves and put our best football on the pitch . ' @entity1 boss @entity0 ( right ) insists @entity3 's players will not be affected by the protests
