@entity0 who was falsely accused of murdering @entity0 by @entity2 the barman wrongly accused by @entity2 of murdering a @entity5 student has urged her to come to court ' if she is as innocent as she claims ' - just hours ahead of a verdict in her appeal trial . @entity0 was held in custody for two weeks after @entity10 , 26 , told police she had ' covered her ears as he killed ' @entity0 in her bedroom of the house she shared with her fellow student . as a result of the false accusation @entity18 was dragged from his home in front of his children and wife , in a dawn raid by police and taken to jail only being released when a university professor provided him with a rock solid alibi . speaking ahead of thursday 's verdict , he said : ' if she ( @entity10 ) is innocent as she should come to court for the decision . ' i will be there . if she is so sure that she had nothing to do with it , then she should be in court to hear the judges decision . ' the unemployed musician added : ' i think she is running away - i 'm the one who has been left in a real mess because of what she said . ' my bar closed and my business folded - i have nothing now and no work . ' because of what she said i was put in jail for two weeks and my bar was impounded by the police for four months . ' my friends tried t help me as best they could but it was n't enough because they were all having a hard time as well . ' the false arrest had a real negative impact on my personal life and my business life - things have never really recovered and it 's all because of what @entity2 wrongly told the police . ' i have n't even been paid any compensation by her that i 'm owed . ' scroll down for video @entity0 ( centre ) walks with his lawyer after he was released by @entity63 police following the false accusation made by @entity2 @entity10 was convicted of slandering @entity18 and ordered to pay him 22,000 euros in 2011 and he was also later awarded 8,000 euros in damages by the @entity63 state but he rejected this to pursue a claim through the @entity69 . @entity10 and her former boyfriend @entity70 , 29 , were charged with murdering and sexually assaulting @entity0 in 2007 , after she was found semi-naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of her house in @entity76 , @entity63 . initially , both were convicted in 2009 and @entity10 was sentenced to 26 years and @entity70 to 25 years but then in 2011 the verdicts were sensationally overturned and both were allowed to go free . but last year , in a case that has been marked with numerous twists and turns , @entity63 's @entity80 ordered a fresh retrial of the appeal . waiting game : @entity70 and @entity2 ( pictured ) who split years ago , are awaiting verdicts in a retrial of their case in @entity63 , after their previous murder convictions were overturned in 2011 that case began last september in @entity93 , 100 miles from where the murder took place . a verdict is due on thursday and prosecutors have demanded custodial sentences be imposed on both @entity10 and @entity70 although neither will be in court for the verdict . @entity70 walks outside the @entity93 court , on monday , january 20 @entity10 has remained in her home at @entity105 , fearful of travelling although she did email the court to protest her innocence in a statement read out by her lawyer , in which she insisted she ' was not a monster . ' judge @entity114 described the emailed statement as ' unusual ' adding that defendants ' should be in court if they wanted to speak . ' computer studies graduate @entity70 , from @entity119 , near @entity120 , is now expected to be in court . there has been speculation in the @entity63 media that he would flee @entity63 ahead of the verdict especially as it has emerged that he has been spending a lot of time in the @entity129 paradise island of the @entity130 which has no extradition treaty . prosecutors have already demanded that should a guilty verdict be returned by judge @entity114 then ' precautionary measures ' should be imposed on @entity70 which could include house arrest and surrounding his passport . in @entity10 's case , it is not entirely clear if the @entity63 authorities will seek her extradition from the @entity142 even though a treaty does exist between both countries . to add to the confusion any verdict will go to a further automatic appeal at the @entity80 so any final decision is likely to be many months , if not years away . court case : @entity70 walks past reporters outside the @entity93 court in @entity63 , on monday of last week this photo taken in november 2007 shows @entity2 ( left ) and @entity70 ( right ) outside the rented house where 21 - year - old @entity5 student @entity0 was found dead the retrial in @entity93 shifted the motive away from a sex game gone wrong as was initially argued to a simple bitter feud of jealousy between @entity10 and @entity0 - with the @entity5 girl uncomfortable at her flatmate 's cleanliness and habit of bringing men home . death : @entity10 and @entity70 served four years in jail for murdering 21 - year - old @entity169 student @entity0 ( pictured ) in @entity76 however @entity10 and her lawyers have hit back and insisted the theory is rubbish , with @entity10 herself stressing that the two were ' good friends ' and she has expressed several times a desire to visit @entity0 's grave and meet her family . the dna evidence from the previous trial has also been revisited with experts being called to testify in particular about a 30cm kitchen knife which was found at @entity70 's home and which was believed to be the murder weapon . at the initial conviction it was said dna from @entity10 was on the handle and that of @entity0 on the blade but the later trial and the appeal established that although there was indeed traces of the @entity142 , those of @entity0 's were so tiny they should not be relied upon . prosecutors want both @entity10 and @entity70 jailed for 26 years , with @entity10 having her one year sentence for slandering @entity18 increased to four . @entity0 's sister @entity198 and brother @entity199 are expected to travel from their home in @entity201 , @entity202 , for the verdict - the third time in seven years that they have attended a court trial related to the killing of their sibling . a third man , @entity212 drifter @entity0 , 27 , is serving a 16 year sentence for the murder and sexual assault and he is expected to be released on parole next year . @entity217 , like @entity10 and @entity70 , has always protested his innocence .
